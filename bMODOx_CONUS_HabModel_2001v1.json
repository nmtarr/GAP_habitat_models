The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA."}, "habitat_description": "The Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura) is widespread throughout the U.S. during summer.  Northern populations migrate south and winter alongside resident populations in the southern portion of its range (Otis et al. 2008).  This species is highly adaptable and breeds in a variety of habitats. It prefers open woodlands, agricultural and residential areas, and forest edges, especially those between forest and prairie environments (Otis et al. 2008).  They typically avoid dense forested areas, extensive forests, wetlands, and swamps (Nicholson 1997, Otis et al. 2008, Stevenson & Anderson 1994).  \r\n\r\nThey forage on seeds of grass, crotons, ragweeds, corn, sorghum, and millet in clearings on ground, upper beaches, in fields, pastures, on and along roads, and at feeders (Stevenson and Anderson 1994 in SC-GAP 2001).  They often feed on seeds left over from crops of previous years, such as sunflower seeds, corn, wheat, and other weed seeds.  When sunflower seeds are in season, they make up the majority of their diet (generally May-October).  They often roost in open fields of sparse vegetation adjacent to nesting or feeding areas.  \r\n\r\nThe highest breeding densities of Mourning Doves occur in agricultural areas of the midwestern, southeastern, and southwestern US.  They build nests up to 40 feet from the ground in the fork of a horizontal tree limb, in a shrub or vine, on top of a deserted nest of another species such as a robin or thrasher, or occasionally on a rock ledge or artificial structure (Nicholson 1997, Ehrlich et al. 1988).  Nest substrates vary somewhat among regions (Otis et al. 2008).  Within the south, they appear to prefer coniferous to deciduous trees for nesting (Baskett et al. 1993), although they will frequently use deciduous trees such as water oak, red oak, sweetgum, and hickory for roosting once leaves emerge (Grand & Mirarchi 1988, Baskett et al. 1993).  However, Fernald (1989) reported this species as regularly breeding in coastal scrub (SC-GAP 2001).  In the East, heavy use is made of conifers and orchard trees, and in central North America shelterbelts, mesquite, and the ground are used.  Nests are placed in cottonwoods, mesquite, salt cedar, orchards, grapevines, palms, and on the ground in the West.\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico, they are found from lowlands up into pine forests, and are casual at higher elevations (2,134-3,963m) (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  They are common summer residents in the Sandia Mountains of New Mexico in pinyon-juniper woodlands and ponderosa pine.  In northwestern Colorado, they are associated with moderate slopes and areas where trees are large, with dead and dying trees.  Near Boulder, Colorado, they are found in douglas-fir-ponderosa pine during the breeding season.  They can be found in association with prairie dog colonies in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah in habitats of shortgrass prairie (Bouteloua spp., Buchloe dactyloides, and Opuntia imbricata), in areas of juniper (Juniperus monosperma) woodland with O. imbricata, and in areas dominated by Artemisia spp (Clark et al. 1982).  In Arizona, they use all habitats types, including Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), except for the densest forests and brush and the most barren deserts (Phillips et al. 1978).  They are found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona.  In southern Nevada, they are found in areas of mesquite dunes dominated by Prosopis juliflora and mesquite bosque, dominated by Prosopis pubescens (Austin 1970).  \r\n\r\nThis species prefers smaller patch size because small patches may be almost entirely edge habitat (Johnson and Igl 2001). \r\n\r\nDetailed accounts of winter habitat associations are not available but they appear to use small and moderate sized woodlots, often moving between sheltered roosting sites and feeding sites, such as fields (Otis et al. 2008).  They winter in desert grasslands and oak savannas of southeastern Arizona. \r\n\r\nN.
