However, near the margins of its range, it may occur in sand dunes\u201d  (O\u2019Farrell and Blaustein 1974).  Hall (1946) reported only sandy soils for the speices, whereas in three areas studied by Ghiselin (1970), gravelly soils were preferred over sandy soils.  Hafner (2005, pers. comm., referring to discussion in Hafner et al. 1996) indicated that the \"single most important determinant of appropriate habitat for this species is sandy soil.\" In California, the species occurs in \"Shadscale Scrub, Sagebrush Scrub, and Alkali Sink, in the fine loose sands and gravels in the Upper Sonoran Life Zone\" (Ingles 1965), and is abundant in sagebrush and alkali desert scrub habitats. However, it is common to uncommon in bitterbrush and low sage habitats (Brylski et al. [CA WHR 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). Hafner (2005, pers. comm.) indicated that \"Throughout the majority of its geographic distribution, the species is most frequently associated with habitats dominated by Artemisia or in habitats where Artemisia, Chrysothamnus, and Tetradymia are predominant. On the margins of its geographic range (particularly in the extreme northwestern, extreme southeastern, and extreme eastern portion of its range where the elevations are low, M. megacephalus is found in habitats lacking Artemisia; in these areas the species is found frequently in habitats dominated by Chrysothamnus and/or Sarcobatus. Seems to avoid areas with heavy grass cover (particularly areas with invasive grasses such as Bromus) and Salsola.\"  \"At no locality is the species found in dense stands of Artemisia; only at localities having well-spaced vegetation\" (Hafner 2005, pers. comm.). Geographic range follows Hall (1981) and Hafner (1985). Minimum elevation reported is 1189 m (Hall 1946) and maximum is 2455 m (Egoscue 1981).  {Unfortunately, for modeling purposes, the \"sandy soils\" data in STATSGO is inadequate for indentifying suitable habitat for the species. Landform classes 1, 2, and 4 are used to help delimit where sandy soils are likely to occur.}.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mDKMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFD02010", "scientific_name": "Microdipodops megacephalus", "ITIS_TSN": "180252", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103824", "common_name": "Dark Kangaroo Mouse"}}
