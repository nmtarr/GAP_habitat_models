In the SWReGAP region it is known only from the mountains of Utah (the southern limits of its range) where it has been found in the Thousand Lake Mountains, Fishlake Plateau, Wasatch Plateau, Wasatch Mtns, and the Uinta Mtns (Durant 1952; Rasmussen and Chamberlain 1959; Johnson and Johnson 1982).  This species has recently been reported further south in Utah, on the west side of the Aquarius Plateau (as found in UMNH and Field Museum specimen records,  Rickart, pers. Comm., 2005).  Although the geographic range of this species is fairly limited, in much of Utah the water vole is the most abundant microtine rodent (Rickart, pers. Comm., 2005).  Distribution is highly discontinuous within its geographic range limits (Ludwig 1984b).\r\nThis species occurs in localized patches in small, linear habitat bordering high elevation mountain streams (Ludwig 1984b; Klaus et al. 2001).  Found in vegetation such as  subalpine and alpine meadows, marshes and willow-sedge savannas near water, especially near swift spring fed or glacial streams with gravel bottoms; less often found on edges of high elevation ponds and marshes  (Jennett 1974; Ludwig 1984b; Doyle 1987).  Typically associated with willows, sedges, rushes, grasses, mesic forbs, mosses, and/or scattered dwarf trees, such as subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Hooven 1973;  Ludwig 1988; Klaus et al. 1999).  Usually it is not captured in forests, though it may rarely be caught here if canopy cover is reduced (Hooven 1973; Doyle 1987).  In the SWReGAP region, it has been trapped on the Wasatch Plateau of Utah (Sanpete Co) in a spring-fed subalpine meadow among marsh marigold (Caltha leptosepala) and watercress (Rorippa rasturtium-aquaticum) (Rasmussen and Chamberlain 1959).  In winter it is subnivean, living beneath snow 7-8 months out of year (Ludwig 1984b).  \r\nThe model uses hydrology because this species is semi-aquatic (Klaus et al. 2001; Ludwig 1984b) and its activity is usually restricted to within 10 m of stream bank (Ludwig 1984a).  May occur in uplands where springs drain into streams and ground is boggy (Ludwig 1984b).  Doyle (1987) notes that Findley (1951) captured small numbers in a dry, alpine meadow that was far from water.  Occupied streams may be ephemeral (Klaus et al. 1999). Creates runways that parallel and crisscross streams (Ludwig 1984b).   The model uses a \"hydrology OR landcover\" overlay; this will  identify appropriate mapped landcover types but also will capture any  high elevation areas within a 50 m buffer of hydrologic features (lakes, springs, wetlands, streams, or intermittent streams) that may be too small to be mapped as a mesic/riparian cover type given the resolution of the landcover map.  Ludwig (1984b) reported that occupied streams had a mean width of 15 m.\r\nOccupied areas tend to be fairly level (approximately a  5 degree slope) along narrow stream channels, possibly because of deeper soils, stable snow depth, or stable subnivean winter temperatures (Ludwig 1984a; Klaus et al. 1999). No habitat was mapped when we included slope in our preliminary models and this attribute is probably too restrictive given the mapping resolution; therefore, we do not include slope in the current model.\r\nAcross its range it has been found from 914 to 3380 m in elevation (Ludwig 1984b; Rasmussen and Chamberlain 1959).  Specimens collected in Utah were from 2370 to 32010 m (Rasmussen and Chamberlain 1959, Wilson and Ruff 1999).  Because the water vole only occurs in mountainous areas (Ludwig 1984a) we used the elevation range specific to Utah in order to restrict the model to the subalpine and alpine zones. \r\nTypically found in deep, continuous soil layer along stream banks where it excavates burrows (Ludwig 1984; Klaus et al. 1999).  However, the available soils data (STATSGO) was too coarse to use in this model.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mNAWVx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11190", "scientific_name": "Microtus richardsoni", "ITIS_TSN": "180315", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102649", "common_name": "North American Water Vole"}}
