Prefers open woodlands near ponds, small lakes, or marshes (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Occurs around farmlands, river bottomlands, beaver ponds (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Forages in and around nesting areas, i.e. open areas near water. Ideal habitats are snags with cavities standing in open water (e.g. beaver ponds).\r\nWinter - \r\nAssumed to be similar to breeding habitats with perhaps an increased preference for open environments (Winkler et al. 2011). Use a wide variety of habitats but generally near water in open country, foraging over marshes and open water - lakes, ponds, open bays, etc. (Hamel 1992).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nRiparian woodlands through aspen zone and into lower levels of coniferous forest zone (Johnsgard 1992). Common summer resident in coniferous forests of northern and central Utah (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). In Colorado, requires open areas for breeding and feeding but need trees for nest cavities (Kingery 1998). Does not nest in the middle of extensive aspen forests, but picks the edges, open glades, and small groves in Colorado (Kingery 1998). Summer resident and transient in Nevada (Alcorn 1988). Nesting occur in parts of northern half of Nevada along streams, rivers, lakes where timber is available; usually nests in abandoned woodpecker holes (Alcorn 1988).  In California, Tree Swallows frequent valley foothill and montane riparian habitats below 2700 m (9000 ft) for breeding. In summer, cover is provided by forest and woodland near water. In winter and migration, uses more open habitats; grasslands, meadows, brushlands, also near water;  inhabits lowlands near estuaries, rivers, lakes, and emergent wetlands (quote from Green et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nIn the east, historical association with beavers that flooded big tracts of forest likely provided an abundance of dead trees where cavities were generated. As secondary cavity-nesters, many of the habitat requirements for breeding Tree Swallows overlap substantially with those of primary cavity-nesters, such as Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus; Dobkin et al. 1995, Lawler and Edwards Jr. 2002)(quoted directly from Winkler et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn British Columbia, Tree Swallows were found to nest in \u201ccavities\u201d as varied as broken tree limbs, hollow stumps, crevices behind bark, downed trees, cracks in rocks, and even a metal bridge piece (Martin et al. 2004, Aitken and Martin 2007, Aitken and Martin 2008). Holt and Martin (1997) examined patch occupancy and reproductive success in relation to successional stage regrowth following clearcutting. Initially, Tree Swallows were only found in two patch types (\u201copen\u201d and \u201ctreed\u201d), mirroring the distribution of natural cavities. Other patch types only occupied with the addition of artificial cavities, i.e. next boxes (quote directly form Winkler et al. 2011).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bTRESx", "ELCode": "ABPAU03010", "scientific_name": "Tachycineta bicolor", "ITIS_TSN": "178431", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101167", "common_name": "Tree Swallow"}}
