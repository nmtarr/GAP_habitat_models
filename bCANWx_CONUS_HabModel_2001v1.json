Human development is usually not suitable habitat but it occupies some villages in the Southwest (Jones and Dieni 1995).  It\u2019s occurrence is not correlated with any vegetative community, as terrain is the important landscape feature for this species (Jones and Dieni 1995).  Cool, shaded, stream-carrying canyons with exposed, steep-walled rock outcrop and a vertical component are a typical setting for the species (Jones and Dieni 1995).  In Arizona, is a common resident about cliffs, hills, adjacent buildings, and high dirt riverbanks (Phillips et al. 1964).  This species prefers low humidity, with an evaporation rate of >190 cm annually (Jones and Dieni 1995).  Canyon Wrens are commonly associated with water but this may merely be so because water is associated with suitable terrain for the species. (Jones and Dieni 1995).  This species has been documented from sea level to 3,000 m but is common between 300 and 1,850 m (Jones and Dieni 1995).  N.
