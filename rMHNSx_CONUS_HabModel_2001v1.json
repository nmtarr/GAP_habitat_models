The Mexican hog-nosed snake is restricted to the lower border of the Rio Grande region in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Predominantly, the range of this species extends south into Matamoros, Mexico (Collins and Taggart 2009; Conant and Collins 1998; Crother et al. 2012; Dixon 1987; Tenant and Bartlett 2000; Werler and Dixon 2000). In 2003, the formal proposal to elevate this snake to species was presented by Smith et al. (2003) based on scale differences; more recently, in the latest update to the list of species, Crother et al. (2012) included the Mexican hog-nosed snake.\r\n\r\nSW-\tHog-nosed snakes are found in prairies, abandoned farm, plains, and sparsely wooded areas. The shovel-like appearance helps them burrow into sandy and loose soils typical of the region. Occurs also in gravelly prairies (arroyos, asequias, intermittent streams, and temporary pools), but also in drier areas like canyons, cultivated land, and open riparian woodlands (Natureserve.org).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rMHNSx", "ELCode": "", "scientific_name": "Heterodon kennerlyi", "ITIS_TSN": "", "Global_SEQ_ID": "", "common_name": "Mexican Hog-nosed Snake"}}
