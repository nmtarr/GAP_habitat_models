Nesting habitat is generally open forest, woodland, or savanna (Wilson et al., 1990; DeGraaf et al., 1991; Johnsgard, 2009) or forest edges (Dice, 1918; Herlugson, 1978; Zeiner et al., 1990; DeGraaf et al., 1991). The species often nests in ponderosa pine woodlands (Dice, 1918; Scott et al., 1977; Brawn, 1990; DeGraaf et al., 1991; Wightman and Germaine, 2006; Dwyer and Block, 2007; Hurteau et al., 2008; Dickson et al., 2009), including those with oak spp. (Horton and Mannan, 1998; Germaine and Germaine, 2002; Wightman and Germaine, 2006; Dwyer and Block, 2007; Miller and Chambers, 2007; Wightman, 2009), quaking aspen (Wauer, 1997; Johnsgard, 2009; Kozma and Kroll, 2010), juniper spp. (Dwyer and Block, 2007), and/or douglas-fir (Russell et al., 2007; Kozma and Kroll, 2010); the presence of gambel oak improves habitat quality in ponderosa pine forest (Wightman and Germaine, 2006). Woodlands of other yellow pines (Wirtz, 1991), such as Jeffrey pine (Weathers, 1983) and foothill pine (Purcell et al., 2007), are also used. Other nesting habitats include oak woodland and savanna (Scott et al., 1977; Wilson et al., 1990; Purcell and Stephens, 2005; Fiehler et al., 2006; Purcell et al., 2007) and pinyon-juniper woodlands (Scott, 1977; Wauer, 1997). Western bluebird will nest in burned forests and woodlands (Germaine and Germaine, 2002; Wightman and Germaine, 2006; Dwyer and Block, 2007; Saab et al., 2007; Wightman, 2009; Saab et al., 2011) as well as in thinned forests (Germaine and Germaine, 2002; Wightman and Germaine, 2006; Hurteau et al., 2008; Wightman, 2009), sometimes with increased abundance following disturbance (Horton and Mannan, 1998; Hurteau et al., 2008; Dickson et al., 2009).\r\n\r\nTree species used for nest sites include: ponderosa pine, narrowleaf cottonwood, quaking aspen, gambel oak (Arsenault, 2004), and blue oak (Wilson et al., 1990), with an apparent preference for aspen (Arsenault, 2004). Nest boxes can facilitate habitation in areas that are otherwise unsuitable for the species (Keyser et al., 2004; Fiehler et al., 2006).\r\n\r\nS. mexicana forages in the herbaceous understory of nesting habitat (Blake, 1982; Wilson et al., 1990; Wightman and Germaine, 2006) as well as in nearby grasslands (Wirtz, 1991; Johnsgard, 2009).\r\n\r\nThe species is rarely found in agricultural areas (Herlugson, 1978; Guinan et al., 2008), desert lowlands (Weathers, 1983; Guinan et al., 2008), grasslands lacking nearby nest sites (Herlugson, 1978), or clearcuts (Herlugson, 1978).\r\n\r\nA minimum elevation constraint of 183 is reported by Keyser et al. (2004). Maximum elevations at which the western bluebird has been documented are ~2900 m in Colorado (Lowe, 1894) and ~1524 m in California (Belding, 1890).\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, the species is found in oak woodlands (Grinnell and Storer, 1924; Anderson, 1970; Kleiber et al., 2007), pinyon and/or juniper woodlands (Miller and Stebbins, 1964; Weathers, 1983; Sullivan, 1995), mesquite bosque/woodland (Miller and Stebbins, 1964), and other low elevation, open areas with proximity to its primary winter food sources of mistletoe berries and juniper berries (Grinnell and Storer, 1924; Miller and Stebbins, 1964; Sullivan, 1995; Kleiber et al., 2007). Weathers (1983) found the species to be absent from both yellow pine woodlands and chaparral during the winter.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bWEBLx", "ELCode": "ABPBJ15020", "scientific_name": "Sialia mexicana", "ITIS_TSN": "179806", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101254", "common_name": "Western Bluebird"}}
