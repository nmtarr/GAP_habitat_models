No known Merriam's shrews have been found on comparable sites outside of the four corners vicinity (see: Azzerad, 2004; Foresman, 2011)\r\n\r\nOn two occasions, S. merriami has been captured among hydric willows and rush grass, and the authors noted that \u201ctypical habitat\u201d for the shrew was within close proximity to these anomalous capture sites (Hall, 1933; Williams, 1984).\r\n\r\nAt a coarse resolution, the species\u2019 range coincides with that of sagebrush, but this is more likely related to shared climatic constraints rather than to S. merriami\u2019s reliance on sagebrush itself (Hafner and Stahlecker, 2002).\r\n\r\nElevational constraints for the species are reported to be between 1828 and 3048 m in Colorado (Armstrong et al., 1973), with a comparable maximum elevation of 2896 reported for California (Hoffman, 1955), and observations in Washington state from as low as 197 m in elevation (James, 1953; Hudson and Bacon, 1956)\r\n\r\nWhile occasionally reported close to water (Hall, 1933), an individual has been captured 3.2 km from open water (Lindsay and Perry, 1977), and no known studies have specifically examined hydrologic requirements.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMESHx", "ELCode": "AMABA01230", "scientific_name": "Sorex merriami", "ITIS_TSN": "179949", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106414", "common_name": "Merriam's Shrew"}}
