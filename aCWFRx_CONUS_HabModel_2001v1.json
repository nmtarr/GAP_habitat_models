Its distribution expands along the Coastal Plain from North Carolina to Florida; along the Gulf Coast into extreme eastern Louisiana and Texas. Also found in some drainage systems of Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Ohio (Behler and King 1979). \r\n\r\nHabitats of preference are tallgrass or outlier prairie, wooded areas along rivers and streams, grasslands, pastures, and degraded grasslands and ever prairies converted to agricultural usage (Lannoo 2005). Its habitat is not restricted to crawfish holes, but it is often found in those that have lost their chimneys and are filled with water; also found in holes in roadside banks, storm or drainage sewers, and even small mammal burrows (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding habitats include shallow ditches, flooded overflows, pasture ponds, and prairie wetlands (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nDamp areas, wooded valleys, oak-history woodlands and floodplains for Southern area (Dodd 2013).
