Its non-native range is west of the Rockies. Populations now established in British Columbia and California. Also introduced into Mexico, Cuba, and Jamaica. High elevation introductions are possible due to warm spring waters from Kelly Warm Springs near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming (2000m) and Hot Springs Creek in Gunnison County, Colorado (Conant and Collins 1998; Degenhardt et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003). New Brunswick and areas of Nova Scotia (Behler and King 1979).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this non-native species of Arizona is found in the Lower Colorado River Desertscrub and even into Petran Montane Conifer Forest where it can be found in rivers, lakes, ditches, stock tanks, and streams (Brennan and Holycross 2009)\r\n\r\nThis highly aquatic species is usually found in or near permanent water. However, its breeding is highly independent of rainfall events. Frequently found in prairie, chaparral, desert oases, forest, woodland, and even farmland. Preferred habitat is characterized by quiet flowing water with dense cattail growth and other vegetation; lakes, ponds, reservoirs, marshes, stock tanks, bogs, sluggish portions of lakes, and streams (Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). Golf course and farm ponds in areas with high bullfrog densities have contributed to the increase in abundance (Willis et al. 1956). Breeding in the northern localities occurs May to July, while the southern populations breed February to October (Behler and King 1979). Breeding is common densely vegetated shallows of permanent bodies of water (Pope 1964). Preferred waters are warm and lentic like sluggish backwaters and oxbows, reservoirs, marshes, vegetated shoals, and still waters with decaying vegetative matter, also in ponds with dense and emergent vegetation (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aAMBUx", "ELCode": "AAABH01070", "scientific_name": "Lithobates catesbeianus", "ITIS_TSN": "775084", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105926", "common_name": "American Bullfrog"}}
