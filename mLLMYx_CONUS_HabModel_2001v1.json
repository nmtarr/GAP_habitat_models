Stock (1970) recorded a single individual at low elevation (~1000 m) in Utah, near riparian vegetation within a creosote and sagebrush shrubland; however, he attributed this observation to migratory use. Easterla (1965) has documented the species as far as three miles from the nearest forest, though he did not indicate the number of individuals or whether it was a migrant or transient.\r\n\r\nThe long-legged bat roosts in: tree cavities or under the bark of both snags and live trees (Jones et al., 1973; Chung-MacCoubrey, 1996; Cryan, 1997; Ormsbee and McComb, 1998; Rabe et al., 1998; Cryan et al., 2001; Allen, 1999; Arnett, 2007; Johnson et al., 2007; Arnett and Hayes, 2009; Lacki et al., 2010); rock outcrops and cliffs (Cryan et al., 2001; Baker and Lacki, 2006); under bridges (Perlmeter, 1996; Pierson et al., 1996; Ormsbee and McComb, 1998); caves (Schowalter, 1980); and in buildings (Dalquest and Ramage, 1946; Findley, 1954; Genoways, 1967).\r\n\r\nThe species forages high above surface and above vegetation (Saunders and Barclay, 1992), typically near water (Jones et al., 1973; Finley et al., 1983; Morrell et al., 1999; Baker and Lacki, 2006), but it has also been observed foraging along cliffs and within riparian forest (Saunders and Barclay, 1992).\r\n\r\nFew studies have explicitly examined or documented the role of water proximity in the species\u2019 habits. Ormsbee and McComb (1998) noted that day roosts averaged from 230 to 352 m from the nearest streams; however, these distances were not significantly different from those of random plots.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of the species\u2019 winter range or of its hibernacula characteristics; however it has been documented hibernating in caves  and mines (Perkins et al., 1990; Szewczak et al., 1998; Oliver, 2000).\r\n\r\nThe species\u2019 elevation range is from near sea-level, along the coast, to 3770 m (Warner and Czaplewski, 1984; Fitzgerald et al., 1994). In the interior of the U.S., the species is generally documented between roughly 2000 and 3000 m in elevation (Hoffman et al., 1969; Finley et al., 1983; Warner and Czaplewski, 1984; Mollhagen and Bogan, 1997; Morrell et al., 1999; Rickart et al., 2008).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLLMYx", "ELCode": "AMACC01110", "scientific_name": "Myotis volans", "ITIS_TSN": "179990", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102173", "common_name": "Long-legged Myotis"}}
