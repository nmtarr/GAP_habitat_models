In New Mexico, this species is associated with low elevation habitats near the Pecos, Rio Grande, and Gila river drainages and areas pertaining to Antelope pass, Hidalgo County, Carlsbad, Eddy County, and Las Cruces, Dona Ana County. Areas near these major drainages are suitable for burrowing, but also tributary arroyos with a combination of slopes and surface rocks represent an appropriate habitat (Degenhardt et al. 1996). The range of the western threadsnake includes south Nevada and southwest Utah, south to Colima and down into the tip of Baja California; west Texas to the south coast of California, and Cottonwood-Sedona area, Yavapai County, Arizona (Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nSW\t-Cropland/hedgerow, riparian zones, desert, grassland/herbaceous, sand/dune, shrubland/chaparral, suburban/orchard, and various woodland types.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWETHx", "ELCode": "ARADD01020", "scientific_name": "Leptotyphlops humilis", "ITIS_TSN": "174337", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105688", "common_name": "Western Threadsnake"}}
