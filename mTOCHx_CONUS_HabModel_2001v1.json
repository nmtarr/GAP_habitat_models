They inhabit old-growth Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar forests with understories of Pacific yew, vine maple, salal, sword fern, Cascade Oregongrape, rhododendron, big-leaf maple and other herbaceous vegetation (Verts and Carraway 1998, Gashwiler 1976). This species tend to be more abundant in uplands than riparian areas and have been negatively correlated with percent cover of deciduous herbs and trees (Doyle 1990, Gashwiler 1976, Verts and Carraway 1998). However, Doyle (1990) found that use of riparian habitats tended to favor breeding females and males potentially acting as a \"source\" area. The typical habitat of T. townsendii is composed of mesic, closed-canopy forest and dense brushy thickets, however, Horn and Babb (1983) studied this species use of clearcuts (of the typical type of forest used elsewhere) and found a preference of foraging on fungi, lichens, and conifer seeds among the herbaceous and shrubby vegetation found in these habitats following removal of all trees from the stands (Sutton 1993).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mTOCHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02040", "scientific_name": "Tamias townsendii", "ITIS_TSN": "180208", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105861", "common_name": "Townsend's Chipmunk"}}
