Considered extirpated from most of lowland southern California, but persisting in coastal Riverside and Orange Counties, and in inland San Diego County; In the north, present near Black Butte Reservoir, Glenn County (Stebbins 2003). Historical and current distribution, at least up to 1994, are nearly unchanged (Jennings and Hayes 1994 in Lannoo 2005). However, they have been extirpated in areas now converted to urban or agricultural settings (Lanno0 2005).\r\n\r\nHabitat is primarily composed of alluvial fans, playas, alkali flats, washes, and floodplains of rivers, foothill grasslands, pine-oak woodlands, and open chaparral, but also reported in mountains and foothills; found specifically in areas of open vegetation and short grasses where soil conditions are usually gravelly or sandy (Stebbins 2003). Can be occasionally found in coastal sage scrub or chaparral nearby breeding pools (Lannoo 2005). Found in shortgrass plains where gravelly and sandy soils predominate such as river floodplains and washes (Behler and King 1979). Most localities are found below 365 meters (Lannoo 2005), while Stebbins 2003 indicate most western spadefoots occur below 910 meters and no higher than 1219; Ervin et al. 2001 reported western spadefoot toads at elevations as high as 1365 meters in San Diego County, California.\r\nBreeding occurs in temporary pools such as vernal lakes, vernal pools, railway and road grades; these isolated pools must last at least 30 days to allow larval development (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aWESPx", "ELCode": "AAABF02020", "scientific_name": "Spea hammondii", "ITIS_TSN": "206990", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100387", "common_name": "Western Spadefoot"}}
