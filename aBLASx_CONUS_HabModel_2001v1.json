The populations found south of Mt. Shasta and east of the Trinity Mountains are separated from the populations observed in the west (Larson 1980; Lynch 1981). This species occurs in lowland forests and meadows of northern California and in extreme southern Oregon in localities where annual precipitation exceeds 75 centimeters. Populations occur generally under 600 meters, but some are reportedly found in localities as high as 1700 meters (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Stebbins 2003). Egg deposition sites include the underside of objects in the lab, while eggs in the wild have been encountered at depths of 23 and 38 cm underground (Van Denburgh 1895; Storer 1925; Lannoo 2005). \r\nAdults are found in lowland forests under rocks and logs, in wet soil along streams, under stones and logs in grassy meadows, burned areas, pastures, and in talus slopes (Stebbins 1951). It is important to note that populations of the Santa Cruz Mountains seem to prefer moister microhabitats then the northern populations, and overall are considered primarily ground dwellers despite having a prehensile tail (Van Denburgh 1895). The species used to be common in many areas now threatened by vineyards in northern California (Green et al. 2013).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBLASx", "ELCode": "AAAAD01030", "scientific_name": "Aneides flavipunctatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173701", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101525", "common_name": "Black Salamander"}}
