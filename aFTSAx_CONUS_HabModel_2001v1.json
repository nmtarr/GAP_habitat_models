Although terrestrial or fossorial as adults, four-toed salamanders are aquatic as larvae, and require a breeding habitat near water; preferably in fishless habitats with sphagnum or other mosses present.  They breed in the fall and lay eggs in the winter or early spring.  Clutch size is variously reported as a dozen or so up to 80.  The eggs are laid in moss or other protected sites immediately above or next to a pool, into which the larvae drop or wriggle after hatching.  The female remains with her eggs until hatching (about 2 months) and communal nesting occurs.  The aquatic larvae metamorphose in about 1.5-2 months and attain sexual maturity about 18 months later.  Thought to be declining, especially due to habitat loss (Petranka 1998).  S.
