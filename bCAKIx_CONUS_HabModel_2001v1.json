Club, Berkeley, CA."}, "habitat_description": "Southwest/Northwest:\r\nThis species needs tall trees for nesting. Primarily eats insects, also spiders and fleshy fruits.  Eastern limits for this species in New Mexico is Clayton and Canadian and Pecos Valleys. Nests in trees near the end of a horizontal branch usually 6 to 12 m above the ground (DeGraaf, 1991). This species will nest in almost any habitat, as long as tall trees are available for nesting sites.  Summer resident of the Sandia Mountains of New Mexico (Tatschl, 1967).  Common in pinyon-juniper woodland in these mountains. Nests almost exclusively in riparian forest habitats.  Occurs in southeastern Arizona; benefits from human manipulation of vegetation and addition of structures such as telephone poles; the height of the trees for this species is more important than the particular species. This species will sometimes occur sympatrically with T. verticalis in southern Arizona north to Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada. This species will nest in any broad habitat zone in which there are tall trees for nesting. This species can be found in southeastern Arizona in riparian forests, with vegetation characterized by sycamore trees (Plantanus wrightii), open riparian areas, also characterized by P. wrightii,  dry creek washes,characterized by willow (Salix spp.) and hackberry (Celtis reticulata) and deserts, characterized by creosote (Larrea tridentata), century plants (Agave spp.), and ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens) (Bock and Bock, 1988). Many of the kingbird nest sites in Arizona were found in yucca-pastureland associations (Blancher and Robertson, 1984). This species is found on recently burned sites, which may be due to increased insect populations.\r\nIn Arizona, breeding evidence (from 317 census blocks where Cassin\u2019s Kingbirds exhibited breeding activity) in these habitat types: riparian 33% of total breeding observations, pi\u00f1on pine-juniper (Pinus edulis - Juniperus sp.) 30%, grassland 11%, rural 10%, other woodland 8%, and desert scrub 5% (Arizona BBA unpubl.). In a study area on east side of Chiricahua Mtns., Cochise Co., 104 of 116 nests were in riparian forest or open riparian woodland between 1,450 and 1,630 m elevation; significant overlap with nesting habitat of Western Kingbird only in open riparian woodland (Blancher and Robertson 1984). Also found breeding in oak woodland, but not in oak-juniper-pine (Balda 1970). In central Arizona, optimum habitat contains large trees surrounded by irrigated fields (Goldberg 1979)(quoted directly from Tweit and Tweit 2000).\r\nAt Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Pima Co., AZ, common in riparian woodland and in smaller numbers in tall trees amid open areas (NWR report unpubl.). In Huachuca Mtns., Cochise Co., most nests between 1,500 and 1,800 m (Swarth 1904). A survey of birds in various canyons in se. Arizona suggests highest numbers of Cassin\u2019s Kingbirds found in canyons with most open habitat available for foraging and large trees for nesting (M. L. Morrison and R. W. Mannan unpubl. report to Coronado National Forest). Cassin\u2019s Kingbird uses wide variety of riparian habitat (18 of 23) types in se. Arizona, while Western Kingbird uses only 10 (Strong and Bock 1990).\r\nIn California: Monterey Co., open oak savanna, isolated patches of deciduous or eucalyptus (Euca-lyptus spp.) trees in grassland and occasionally mixed oak (Quercus spp.)-riparian forest (Roberson 1993). In other parts of state, also breeds in broad coastal valleys, grassy bluffs on headlands, and windbreaks around agricultural fields. In mountains, breeds in open pine forests, and among isolated juniper and sagebrush (Artemesia sp.) flats. In isolated eastern mountain ranges, breeds in pi\u00f1on pine, Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) and other yuccas. Nests from 100 m elevation near coast to 1,800 m in eastern mountains (Grinnell and Miller 1944, Small 1994)(quoted directly from Tweit and Tweit 2000).\r\nIn Colorado BBA, 48% of blocks with breeding evidence in pi\u00f1on-juniper habitat (13% of total pi\u00f1on-juniper blocks), 19% in lowland riparian, 18% in short-grass prairie, and 10% in rural shelterbelts. Highest densities in pi\u00f1on-juniper found on mesas and in canyons bordering Apishapa and Purgatoire rivers. Habitat overlaps with Western Kingbird only in riparian woodland and rural shelterbelts (Jones 1998)(quoted directly from Tweit and Tweit 2000).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn New Mexico, breeding elevation ranges from 1,300 m near Lordsburg (Hidalgo Co.) to 2,400 m in Zuni (Cibola Co.) and Capitan (Lincoln Co.) Mtns. and Santa Fe Co. (Bailey 1928). Nests in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) near Lake Burford (Rio Ariba Co.; Wetmore 1920). Found in sagebrush not far from timber and steep ravines (Henshaw 1875). In Los Alamos Co., pi\u00f1on-juniper habitat preferred over ponderosa with all 6 pi\u00f1on-juniper blocks occupied, 76% of 21 mixed ponderosa-pi\u00f1on-juniper and only 36% of 11 pure ponderosa blocks occupied (Travis 1992). In Oklahoma, found in cottonwoods (Populus fremonti) and other large trees (Sutton 1967). In Trans-Pecos Texas, 52% of 42 nests found in shrubs or trees in grassland, 24% in riparian woodland flanked by grassland or desert scrub, 12% in desert scrub, 7% in pine-oak-juniper and 5% in suburban locations. Of these nests, 83% were above 1,200 m elevation, with a mean of 1,435 m (Ohlendorf 1974)(quoted directly from Tweit and Tweit 2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCAKIx", "ELCode": "ABPAE52030", "scientific_name": "Tyrannus vociferans", "ITIS_TSN": "178288", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100652", "common_name": "Cassin's Kingbird"}}
