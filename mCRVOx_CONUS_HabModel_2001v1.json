In California they common in herbaceous and shrubby understories of riparian and moist coniferous forest and wet meadows. Burrows are excated in friable soils under litter and desnser herbaceous growth, and within log cavities. They are also found in burned and clearcut forest and other early succesional stages (Brylski and Harris based on Zeiner et al. 1990). This species is most abundant in more xeric sites, especially those supporting stands of short grass, but may favor riparian areas in some localities (Verts and Carraway 1985, Wilson and Ruff 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCRVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11110", "scientific_name": "Microtus oregoni", "ITIS_TSN": "180313", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106060", "common_name": "Creeping Vole"}}
