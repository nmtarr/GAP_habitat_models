Also in Big Sandy River near Wikieup in Mohave County, Arizona. Due primarily to the overlap of their ranges, Woodhouse\u2019s toad is reported to hybridize with A. fowleri (now distinct species), A. punctatus, A. microscaphus, A. boreas, and A. speciosus (Stebbins 2003). \r\nOccurs in the Dakotas to central Texas, mostly west of the Rocky Mountains (Conant and Collins 1998; Hammerson 1999). In Arizona, this species is mostly abundant along farmland, rivers, across desert scrub into woodland (Brennan and Holycross 2009).\r\n\r\nIndividuals aggregate even in suburban and urban settings; they occur in places like Las Vegas where they were not historically found. Similarly, they range has extended into agricultural areas, especially in southern California nearby Palm Springs (Lannoo 2005).\r\nThis species is found across a wide variety of habitats, from grassland, woods, sagebrush flats, desert streams, floodplains, valleys, and even farms and backyards. The habitat can be characterized by the presence of sandy substrate. Breeding takes place in preferably quiet streams, marshes, swales, river bottoms, mountain canyons, freshwater pools, lakes, and irrigation ditches (Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). In general, Woodhouse\u2019s toads are associated with low elevation, large riparian corridors; canals, golf courses, urban parks that have ponds, and even irrigated fields (Lannoo 2005). Breeding in most of their range occurs after rains, but in areas of the Sonoran Desert, breeding may take place during warm nights independent of rain (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aWOTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01180", "scientific_name": "Anaxyrus woodhousii", "ITIS_TSN": "773532", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103855", "common_name": "Woodhouse's Toad"}}
