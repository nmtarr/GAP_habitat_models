Rocky streams with a shallow gradient and sluggish flow seem to be shunned (Folkerts 1971).  More aquatic than most of the other member of the genus and is seldom encountered far from water. Seal salamanders are found in most forested stream situations within their range (Martof et al. 1980), but are primarily associated with hardwood forests (Petranka 1998).  In the Piedmont, they may occur locally in small streams within cool, forested ravines in association with other species of northern affinities. Very localized in Florida, usually found in seepage springs in association with sandstone, clay, or limestone and with mixed deciduous and evergreen hardwoods on slopes (Means 1992).  By day, seal salamanders shelter under rocks or in burrows, often taking to water when disturbed. Populations range in elevation as high as 1555m, but are most abundant at elevations between 1219 to 1372 m (Petranka 1998).  Eggs are laid on undersides of rocks or leaves in water or seepages and also under or in logs near water.  They hatch late summer to early fall.  The larval period is fully aquatic.  Males require at least 5 years to attain sexual maturity, females first oviposit at 5-7 years (Bruce 1989; Castanet et al. 1996).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSEASx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03060", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus monticola", "ITIS_TSN": "173640", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102693", "common_name": "Seal Salamander"}}
