Martof et al. (1980) states, 'It inhabits the main streams and larger tributaries of the Neuse and Tar rivers from well above tidewater into the lower piedmont.'  In the Piedmont and along fall line it inhabits moderate to swift flowing streams.  In the coastal plain it is found in or near the main stream of the Neuse and Tar rivers and their major tributaries.  Quiet, backwaters and floodplain swampy areas with large amounts of leaf litter covering the substrate have been identified by some as the principal habitat of this species (Martof et al. 1980, Wilson 1995).  However, others identify main channels of moderately sized streams with hard-clay substrate as the waterdog's primary dwelling place (Petranka 1998).  From the studies leading to these differing observations, it is clear that the entire body of water is utilized, perhaps in support of different eco-biological functions.  They require relatively high oxygen levels and water quality (Ashton 1990).  Eggs are attached to the undersides of objects in water.  Much or their habitat has been lost due to rapid and large-scale development and construction impoundments.   Eggs are probably laid in the spring and hatch in June-July.  Paedomorphic, sexual maturity attained in about 6 years.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aNRWAx", "ELCode": "AAAAE01030", "scientific_name": "Necturus lewisi", "ITIS_TSN": "173627", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100341", "common_name": "Neuse River Waterdog"}}
