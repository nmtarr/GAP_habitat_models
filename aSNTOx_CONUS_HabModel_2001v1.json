In New Mexico, occurs only in southwestern Hidalgo County near Rodeo, and in the adjacent Peloncillo Mountains (Degenhardt et al. 1996).Fouquette et al. (in press) describe distribution as essentially restricted to the Sonoran Biotic Province.\r\n\r\nHabitat (general) \r\nFouquette (1970) describes habitat as primarily desert, but also occurs in grassland and lower oak woodland. Stebbins (1985) describes habitat as arid mesquite-creosote bush lowlands and arid grasslands into oak-sycamore-walnut groves in mountain canyons, and states that it is widespread throughout the desert. In New Mexico, it occurs in desert shrub characterized by broad flat expanses of creosote and mesquite, in rocky riparian zones of cottonwood and sycamore, and in both muddy stock ponds and those with abundant aquatic vegetation (Degenhardt et al. 1996). In Arizona, Lowe (1964) describes habitat as primarily desert, and less frequent in grassland and the lower edge of oak woodland. In more localized surveys, Bufo alvarius was found in desertscrub, semidesert grassland, and riparian areas at Saguaro National Park (Lowe and Holm 1991).  Jones (1988) recorded the following habitats for Bufo alvarius:  Closed Chaparral, Open Chaparral, Desert Grassland, Cottonwood-Willow Riparian, Mesquite Bosque / floodplain woodland, Mixed Riparian (Xeroriparian) Scrub, Mojave Desertscrub, Sonoran Desertscrub (Arizona Upland)\r\n\r\nWater\r\nFoquette (1970) states that \u201cthey apparently depend on the presence of rather permanent water, although frequently breeding in temporary pools\u201d. Fouquette et al. (in press) list seasonal and permanent pools as breeding sites, including irrigation ditches and stock tanks.  \r\n\r\nSpecial habitat features\r\nTemporary or permanent water for breeding.\r\n\r\nElevational range\r\nStebbins (1985) and Foquette (1970) list sea level to 1610 m (5300 ft). In the Pinaleno Mountains, Nickerson and Mays (1969[1970]) collected two at 976 m and 1280 m (3200 and 4200 ft).  Painter (NMHERP 1996) suggests this species occurs within \"SW Hidalgo Co., variable habitat in Animas and Peloncillo Mts., intermountain valleys; ca 4100-6200' elev.\"  We used an elevational range is 0 \u2013 1890 m.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSNTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01010", "scientific_name": "Ollotis alvaria", "ITIS_TSN": "775976", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104462", "common_name": "Sonoran Desert Toad"}}
