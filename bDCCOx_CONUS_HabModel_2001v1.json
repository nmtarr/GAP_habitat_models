It breeds in the interior of North America from central Canada south through Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and the Midwest as well as in the Northwest, Northeast, and Florida (Hatch and Weseloh 1999).  It winters in largest numbers on the Pacific Coast and the Gulf of Mexico, but also may be found in some portions of the interior in smaller numbers, such as along the lower Colorado River (Hatch and Weseloh 1999).  In Arizona, it breeds and winters along the lower Colorado River but it is a rare migrant elsewhere in the state (Phillips et al. 1964, Hatch and Weseloh 1999).  In Colorado, most breeding occurs on large reservoirs on the east slope of the Rockies and in the eastern plains, with large colonies breeding regularly around the Denver area (Andrews and Righter 1992, Potter 1998).  Populations have also been noted from the west slope of the Rockies during breeding season.  Though breeding has not been confirmed here yet, it likely will in the future given the population expansion in Colorado and the fact that cormorants breed in eastern Utah (Potter 1998).  In Nevada the cormorant is a common breeder in the western and southern portions of the state (Alcorn 1988, Hatch and Weseloh 1999) and it also has been documented in eastern Nevada (GBBO, unpublished Nevada Breeding Bird Atlas data, GBBO, unpublished NBC data).  It is transient over most of the state during migration (Alcorn 1988).  In New Mexico, it is a common migrant with some breeding occurring locally on large water bodies.  It is abundant year-round on reservoirs in south-central New Mexico on impoundments along the Rio Grande (Ligon 1961, Caldwell et al. 1999).  In Utah, the Double-crested Cormorant is a common summer resident where it has been known to breed in the refuges on Bear Lake and along the Great Salt Lake, and also on larger reservoirs and streams from Pelican Lake in northeast Utah, south to Millard and Sevier Counties.  It migrates throughout the state and rarely will overwinter in Utah during mild winters (Hayward et al. 1976, Behle et al. 1985). \r\n\r\nDouble-crested Cormorants nest in groves of trees on large expanses of open water with abundant and reliable fish populations, including slow-moving rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, marshes, and estuaries (Ligon 1961, Findholt 1988, Johnsgard 1993, Potter 1998, Hatch and Weseloh 1999).  Suitable nest sites require nearby food supply (primarily fish) (Potter 1998).  Nest trees are usually standing in water or are on islands (Hatch and Weseloh 1999) and in the Southwest are almost always cottonwoods (Populus sargentii, P. angustifolia) but also box elders (Acer negundo) and exotics such as tamarix (Tamarix sp.) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) (Mitchell 1977, Ottenbacher 1994, Quinn et al. 1996, Potter 1998, Caldwell et al. 1999, Hatch and Weseloh 1999, Skagen et al. 2001).   They will also use artificial nest platforms (Quinn et al. 1996).  Island nesting occurs on some lakes and reservoirs in Colorado, Nevada, and Utah (Hayward et al. 1976, Behle et al. 1985, Alcorn 1988, Potter 1998).   Scattered breeding colonies exist throughout the Southeast, where they are most often in coastal areas along estuaries, bays, inlets, swamps, lagoons, and marine islands but also occur inland along the edges of large reservoirs, lakes, and slow-moving rivers.  Although they usually nest in trees or snags, they may nest on the ground in areas that are predator-free, such as on islands (Potter 1998, Hatch and Weseloh 1999).  Ground nests are usually in rocky areas with little vegetation but sometimes are placed on sand or mats of emergent marsh vegetation.  On rocky islands in the Utah's Great Salt Lake, ground nests were constructed of sagebrush (Artemisia sp.) and greasewood (Sarcobatus sp.) (Behle 1958).  \r\n\r\nIn southwestern Utah, cormorants were found throughout summer on larger reservoirs but often were absent in mid-summer at lower elevation reservoirs (Ottenbacher et al. 1994).  Habitat distribution in the Southwest may change with fluctuating water levels (Ottenbacher et al. 1994) and as nesting kills trees (Findholt 1988).  This species is probably most limited by nesting habitat since foraging habitat is abundant in reservoirs (Findholt 1988).  It also requires perch sites in all seasons for resting and nighttime roosting, usually on rocks, sandbars, pilings, wires, or trees (Hatch and Weseloh 1999).  The Double-crested Cormorant occurs from sea level (Hatch and Weseloh 1999) up to 2,743 m in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992), but most records in Colorado are from below 1,828 m (Andrews and Righter 1992).  In southwestern Utah, they are found from 910 m to 2,695 m (Ottenbacher et al. 1994).\r\n\r\nDouble-crested Cormorants forage in open water and estuaries; usually in shallow water < 8 m deep that is less than 5 km from shore (Hatch and Weseloh 1999).   In southwestern Utah, they were found only on larger reservoirs (66 to 2,688 ha surface area) (Ottenbacher et al. 1994).  They have been observed traveling up to 62 km from a breeding or roosting site during a foraging trip but most individuals appear to forage closer to their colonies.  Because the Double-crested Cormorant consumes fish and frequents aquaculture sites, it has historically been viewed as a pest species, and nest sites were often destroyed (Weseloh 1977, Hatch and Weseloh 1999).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, Double-crested Cormorants inhabit areas of open water with suitable roosting areas nearby, which can be trees, man-made structures, or bare ground (Hatch and Weseloh 1999).  Wintering areas have minimum January temperature over -1 degrees Celsius (30 deg F) (Root 1988).  They are rare in Colorado in winter but a few individuals may remain in the state in water that remains free of ice.  They are a common migrant on the eastern foothills and plains (Andrews and Righter 1992, Potter 1998).  They follow coastlines and river valleys during migration, avoiding even visible shortcuts over land (Johnsgard 1993).   N.
