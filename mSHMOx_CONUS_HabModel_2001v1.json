Isolated populations occur in Shasta and Plumas cos. Optimal habitats are Douglas-fir, redwood, mixed conifer, montane hardwood and montane riparian with dense, moist\r\nunderstories. Also found in wet meadow and fresh emergent wetland habitats. Generally\r\nfound below 250 m (800 ft), but recorded to 2500 m (8000 ft)\" (quoted directly from CA WHR [Harris et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In Oregon, this species is abundant in ravines with silty soils and areas of thick humus layers of leaves and twigs. Dominant vegetation in these habitats include big-leaf and vine maples, red alder, dogwood, various Rubus brambles, mossess, and ferns. They can be found less frequently in willow thickets, conifer forests, riparian hardwoods, pasturelands, shrubs, and headland prairies (Dalquest 1941, Dalquest and Orcutt 1942, Maser et al. 1981, Terry 1981, Verts and Carraway 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSHMOx", "ELCode": "AMABB01010", "scientific_name": "Neurotrichus gibbsii", "ITIS_TSN": "179975", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100668", "common_name": "Shrew-mole"}}
