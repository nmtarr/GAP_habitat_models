Woodlands in which the species is found include: aspen, incense cedar, white fir, engleman spruce, ponderosa pine, mixed ponderosa and scrub oak, blue oak, live oak, digger pine, and pinon-juniper. It can also be found in open chaparral and shrub/scrub communities of sagebrush, cactus, mesquite, creosotebush, or ceanothus. T. bottae\u2019s grassland habitats include alpine meadows, shortgrass and mixed-grass plains or prairies, oak savannas, and montane grasslands. The species also utilizes agricultural habitats, especially alfalfa and corn cropland, pastures, and hay fields (Jones and Baxter, 2004).\r\n\r\nT. bottae has been recorded at elevations as high as 14,000 feet in California (Bole, 1938).\r\n\r\nBotta's pocket gophers burrow in loose sands and silts to tight clays (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish  2000). Burrow depth varies with soil conditions: less than a foot in some rocky areas to three feet deep in deep sandy soils (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish  2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBOGOx", "ELCode": "AMAFC01020", "scientific_name": "Thomomys bottae", "ITIS_TSN": "180222", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100356", "common_name": "Botta's Pocket Gopher"}}
