University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, Utah."}, "habitat_description": "The range of the Uinta ground squirrel (Urocitellus armatus, formerly Spermophilus armatus) is a relatively small geographic area in the Intermountain West (Zeveloff 1988; Eshelman and Sonneman 2000): a narrow strip in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah (as far south as the Fishlake Plateau), west to Raft River Mountains of nw Utah, broadening northeast into the Uinta Mountains of Utah, e. Idaho, w. Wyoming and s.w. Montana (Durrant 1952, Zeveloff 1988). The Green River is believed to be a barrier to its distribution to the east (Svihla 1931).  In Utah, the Wasatch Front marks its extreme western limit with the exception of the Raft River Mountains in the nw corner, where they are relatively abundant (Berryman 1948, Durrant 1952).  It occurs in abundance locally but presence is spotty within its limited range (Yensen 1999). \r\n\r\nThey generally inhabit large, open areas in mountains, foothills, and high valleys such as cultivated fields, lawns, pastures, montane and subalpine grassy meadows, sagebrush shrublands, and sagebrush-steppe  (Durrant 1952; Balph and Stokes 1963; Knopf and Balph 1977; Parmenter and MacMahon 1983; Zeveloff 1988; Rieger 1996; Yensen 1999; Eshelmann and Sonnemann 2000).    \r\n\r\nIn the Raft River Mountains of nw Utah, colonies were in a big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata)- snowberry (Symphoricarpos utahensis) shrubland with forbs and grasses (Poa spp.) in the understory (Berryman 1948).  Knopf and Balph (1977) note a population in northern Utah occurring around a corral along an interface of sagebrush and aspen at the subalpine zone (2438 m).  In the Bridger-Teton National Park, Wyoming, McGee (1982) found the species in unburned, dense, homogenous stands of  mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana) with grasses and forbs forming a continuous understory.  It also had been found in sagebrush-steppe in Wyoming, where dominant shrubs were big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus) with endemic and introduced grasses such as Agropyron spp., Poa spp., Stipa spp., Bromus tectorum, Elymus elymoides, Oryzopsis hymenoides, and Hordeum jubatum (Parmenter and MacMahon 1983; Minta 1992).  Uses agricultural areas; for example, Uinta ground squirrels used a pasture in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, composed of mostly Kentucky blue grass (Poa spp.) but also bromegrass (Brome spp.) and dandelions (Taraxacum spp.) (Rieger 1996).  Knopf and Balph (1977) note a population in an area bordering irrigated alfalfa fields in Cache Valley, Utah. The species has also been found in developed areas, such as in lawns among buildings of the Utah State University Experimental Station, and on the University of Utah campus (Balph and Stokes 1963; Slade and Balph 1974; Balph 1984).\r\n \r\nSeems to favor well-drained, soft-bottomed areas for burrows rather than rocky hillsides; these areas may include mine spoil pits and banks of stream and canals ( Svihla 1931; Berryman 1948; Durrant 1952; Parmenter and MacMahon 1983).  However, in the literature there was no mention of any association with a particular soil type, therefore we do not use the soils layer in this model.  In Utah, burrows were often located beneath sagebrush shrubs (Berrryman 1948).  \r\n\r\nFound at elevations from 1219 m along the Snake River in Idaho (Eshelman and Sonnemann 2000) up to 3048 m near Brighton, Utah (Durrant 1952), but usually occurs below 2438 m (Zeveloff 1988).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mUGSQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB05050", "scientific_name": "Spermophilus armatus", "ITIS_TSN": "930314", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104586", "common_name": "Uinta Ground Squirrel"}}
