Most foraging and roosting takes place in such habitats, within: wooded riparian areas (Jackson and Herder, 1997; Kuenzi et al., 1999; Gitzen et al., 2002; Lausen and Schowalter, 2008); mixed conifer forest (Jones, 1965; Roemer, 1994; Ports and Bradley, 1996; Siders, 2004; Adams and Thibault, 2006; Rickart et al., 2008); ponderosa pine forest (Findley et al., 1975; Jackson and Herder, 1997; Fenton et al., 1980); mixed woodland and encinal (Jones, 1965; Findley et al., 1975; Ports and Bradley, 1996; Foster et al., 1997); and pinyon-juniper forest and woodland (Chung-MacCoubrey, 1996; Foster et al., 1997; Jackson and Herder, 1997; Szewczak et al., 1998; Kuenzi et al., 1999; Siders, 2004).\r\n\r\nIn the Great Basin region, the Columbia plateau, and northwestern Great Plains, the species has been reported in desert scrub (Fenton et al., 1980; Worthington, 1991; Jackson and Herder, 1997; Szewczak et al., 1998; Kuenzi et al., 1999) and sagebrush habitats (Easterla, 1965; Siders, 2004); however, in the southwest, the species eschews shrublands in favor of more mesic, higher elevation woodlands and forests (Holloway and Barclay, 2001; Rickart et al., 2008; AZGFD, 2011). According to the Arizona Game and Fish Department (2011), M. ciliolabrum rarely occurs below the ponderosa pine zone. Findley et al. (1975) also found that the majority of observations in New Mexico were from woodland zones and above; 24% were from lower zones, but this designation included low elevation riparian woodlands.\r\n\r\nRoost sites have been documented in: rock crevices (Fitzgerald et al., 1994; Hendricks et al., 1995); caves (Worthington, 1991; Fitzgerald et al., 1994); talus and among rock piles (Fitzgerald et al., 1994; Hendricks et al., 1995; Lausen and Schowalter, 2008); mudstone erosion holes (Lausen and Schowalter, 2008); in buildings (Fitzgerald et al., 1994; Hendricks et al., 1995; Gitzen et al., 2002); and occasionally under bark (Fitzgerald et al., 1994); under bridges (Hendricks et al., 2005); and in tunnels and mines (Armstrong, 1972).\r\n\r\nHibernacula are generally caves and mines (Turner and Jones, 1968; Perkins et al., 1990; Szewczak et al., 1998; Oliver, 2000; Tigner and Stukel, 2003), though the species has been documented as active during the winter, as far north as Alberta (Lausen and Barclay, 2006).\r\n\r\nThe small-footed myotis generally avoids grasslands (Fitzgerald et al., 1994; Holloway and Barclay, 2000); the few documented occurrences attributed to grasslands were at sites with spruce, aspen, cottonwood, or sagebrush (Findley et al., 1975; Holroyd, 1994; Foster et al., 1997; Siders, 2004). Furthermore, the species is absent from riparian woodlands that lack nearby badlands or cutbanks (Holloway and Barclay, 2000).\r\n\r\nM. ciliolabrum forages along cliffs and rocky slopes rather than over water (Hendricks et al., 1995). Nevertheless, the species is only found near water bodies, mostly within 500 m (Holroyd et al., 1994; Holloway and Barclay, 2000; Adams and Thibault, 2006)\r\n\r\nElevations at which the species has been observed range from near sea level in California (Zeiner et al., 1990) to nearly 3000 m in Utah (Foster et al., 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWSFMx", "ELCode": "AMACC01140", "scientific_name": "Myotis ciliolabrum", "ITIS_TSN": "179994", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103346", "common_name": "Western Small-footed Myotis"}}
