It occurs in interior chaparral, plains grassland, oak savannah and oak scrub, woodland rabbitbrush, coniferous forest,  low-altitude deserts and lava fields of AZ and NM, pigmy-conifer woodland, juniper-savannah,  montane grassland, Mohave desertscrub, and scrub grassland (Hart 1992). It likes caves, cliff, ledges, rock outcrops, and steep slopes. Cliff/rock outcrops essential for den sites.  Also makes burrows (NatureServe 2001).  NM- species found only west of the Rio Grande and mainly mountains south of I-40.  It eats seeds of the sage, serviceberry, Russian Thistle, Arizona walnut, hackberry, and currants.  Feeds on salsify, bluegrass, wild carrot, arrowleaf balsamroot, elk thistle, mountain dandelion, wild rose, prickly pear, cliff rose, wild plums, shadbush, lupine, and composite seeds.  It is found at elevations of 0-3,700m (Thompson et al. 1996, NatureServe 2001). In NV it is more common on south facing slopes at low elevations (Hart 1992). The home range is 0.1ha (NatureServe 2001).  The cliff chipmunk occurs from southeast Arizona acroos the Mogollon Plateau to the northwest, as well as Defiance Plateau (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in Northwest Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, NatureServe).  The species occurs in eastern Nevada (Hall 1995). It is found west of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, except in the San Juan Basin and the Jemez and San Juan mountains (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It is likely within the mountains throughout Utah (Durrant 1952).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Wyoming, T. dorsalis is present in communities designated as the Wyoming Basin Faunal Area of North America (Armstrong, 1977). In Colorado, it is present only in two community types, saxicolus brush and pygmy-conifer woodlands, members of the Yuman faunal element whose center of distribution is the lower Colorado River drainage (Armstrong, 1972). In Utah, the cliff chipmunk is present in a variety of plant communities and associations also including sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata), big tooth maple (Acer grandidentatum), four-winged saltbrush (Atriplex canescens), snakeweed (Guitierrezia microphyla), and bromegrass (Bromus tectorum; Hart, 1967; Honeycutt et al., 1981)(quoted directly from Hart 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCLCHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02110", "scientific_name": "Tamias dorsalis", "ITIS_TSN": "180193", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103986", "common_name": "Cliff Chipmunk"}}
