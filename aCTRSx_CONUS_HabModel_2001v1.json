In Oregon, this species occurs south to the Middle Fork of the Willamette River (Good and wake 1992; Lannoo 2005). Stebbins (2003) noted occurrences in Skamania County, Washington, and Lane County in Oregon. Elevational range for this species is varied, but not entirely understood; populations have been reported at 1219 meters, but most have been studied at around 870 meters (Good and Wake 1992; Lannoo 2005). It is important to note that Cascade torrent salamanders are usually not reported downstream, where gradients are lower and present fewer opportunities for suitable habitat (Hunter 1998). Previous research on larval density in the Columbia River gorge, found the Cascade torrent salamander to have one of the highest density in comparison to any other Rhyacotriton salamander averaging 33.3 larvae/m2 (Nussbaum and Tait 1977). Adults at the same locality by Wahkeena Falls averaged 1.9 adults/m2 (Nijhuis and Kaplan 1998). Egg deposition sites are associated with coarse substrate spaces in slow velocity flow seeps. Larvae have been reported under stones along stream channels and in fissure networks found in the streambed and bank (Nussbaum and Tait 1977).\r\n\r\nAs adults, preferred habitat includes underground water courses, rocky rubble found in stream banks, fissures by stream banks, and cracks in wet cliffs (Leonard et al. 1993; Corkran and Thoms 1996).\r\n\r\nMaximum size of basins where torrent salamanders were reported was 141 ha (348 ac; Hunter 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCTRSx", "ELCode": "AAAAJ01030", "scientific_name": "Rhyacotriton cascadae", "ITIS_TSN": "550250", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102976", "common_name": "Cascade Torrent Salamander"}}
