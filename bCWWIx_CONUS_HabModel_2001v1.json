Also found in live oak groves, forest edges, and riparian areas.  Openings, including forest gaps, patures, and scrub, appear to be an important habitat for foraging.  Does well in areas of suburban growth provided there is enough forest cover remaining.   Along the southern coast, found especially in upland deciduous areas; farther north, found in thickets along the edge of marshes (Fussell 1994). Regularly breeding in coastal scrub (Fernald 1989).  They are also reported to breed in open pine flatwoods, longleaf pine, xerophytic oak woodlands, hardwoods, and tropical hammocks (Stevenson and Anderson 1994).
