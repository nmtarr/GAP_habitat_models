This species prefers mature forest, especially where oaks are common (Mowbray 1999). It is more common in areas with a relatively closed canopy, a dense understory with a high diversity of shrubs, and scanty ground cover(Bushman and Therres 1988). The scarlet tanager also sometimes nests in wooded parks, orchards, and large shade trees of suburbs (Isler and Isler 1987, Senesac 1993).  Although the species breeds in various forest stages, it is most abundant in mature woods. The scarlet tanager displays a significant dependancy on forest tract size; a forest tract of 10-12 ha is estimated to be necessary to sustain a viable population of the species (Mowbray 1999).\r\n\r\nThis species builds its nests at the tip of horizontal branches ranging from 6 to 60 feet above the ground. This species forages by hawking and gleaning insects, sometimes from loose bark, and will also eat berries and nectar (Ehrlich et al. 1988). The scarlet tanager spends most of its time in the upper canopy of forest stands (Nicholson 1997).  M.
