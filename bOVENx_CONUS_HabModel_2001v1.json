Disjunct breeding populations also reside in central and southeastern Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992, Van Horn and Donovan 1994, Kingery 1998). Wintering populations reside in the southern Gulf Coast states, North Carolina, the West Indies, and Panama to northern South America (Van Horn and Donovan 1994). During migration, the Ovenbird is a rare to uncommon spring and fall migrant in Colorado and New Mexico. In Colorado, this bird is rare during spring and fall migrations on the eastern plains and accidental in lower mountains (Andrews and Righter 1992).  In New Mexico, this bird is a regular migrant throughout much of the state (BISON-M). \r\n\r\nBreeding habitats for the Ovenbird include relatively mature, large, contiguous tracts of deciduous or mixed deciduous/coniferous closed-canopy forests where deciduous trees are the chief component (Van Horn and Donovan 1994, Porneluzi et al. 2011).   Forests with less ground cover, deeper leaf litter, and higher prey biomass than average are preferred (Porneluzi et al. 2011).  Ovenbirds are most abundant in mature subxeric deciduous and deciduous mixed forests with a relatively closed canopy and open understory, as well as some moderately mesic forest types in transition to moister conditions (Palmer-Ball 1996, NatureServe 2005).  In general they prefer hilly terrain and are associated with large tracts of contiguous, interior forest habitat (Van Horn & Donovan 1994).  Typical forest types include oak hickory, oak-pine, maple-basswood, maple-birch, maple-birch-beech, hemlock-oak, Trembling Aspen, mature jack pine, and spruce-fir (Porneluzi et al. 2011, NatureServe2005, Hamel 1992).  This species builds dome-shaped nest out in the open on the leaf-covered forest floor, or in a clump of fern, grasses, or other low plants, or at the base of a shrub, sapling, or stump (Dunn and Garrett 1997).  It may also be built into a slight depression (Griscom and Sprunt 1957). The nest is often placed near a forest opening such as a trail or road. The nest is constructed mostly from dead leaves; grasses, pine needles, hair, and fibers are also used (Dunn and Garrett 1997).  It is always topped with leaves and branches and has a small entrance in the side (Ehrlich et al. 1988) which usually faces downhill (Nicholson 1997).  Ovenbirds sing from low branches (Alsop 1991), and almost always forage on the ground (Ehrlich et al. 1988) in the leaf litter and in fallen logs, but will occasionally forage in a tree (Dunn and Garrett 1997). \r\n\r\nOvenbirds in the Southwest use large tracts of contiguous woodlands and avoid climax coniferous forests (Kingery 1998).  Ovenbirds nesting in Colorado nest in habitats unlike those in the eastern US (Kingery 1998). They are known to breed in foothill riparian thickets and in aspen or ponderosa pine forests with an understory of Gambel oak or other shrubs (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Vegetation communities suitable for breeding in Colorado include Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwood-willow (Populus- Salix spp.), lodgepole (Pinus contorta) and ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) pine, Douglas fir (Arceuthobium douglasii), sage (Artemisia spp.), and mountain shrubs (BISON-M). \r\n\r\nOvenbirds prefer a canopy height of 16-22m with 60-90% canopy closure (Van Horn and Donovan 1994). Depending upon the forest type, the Ovenbirds require 100 to 885 ha of interior forests for breeding (Kingery 1998).  Hunter (1990) identified that this species occurrence peaks with tracts at 1125 acres (455 Ha).\r\n\r\nDuring migration in the southwest, the Ovenbird will use lowland riparian forests, shrublands, and wooded urban areas (Andrews and Righter 1992). In New Mexico, these areas occur at lower elevations between 853 to 1,676m (BISON-M). General non-forest habitat associations for this species during migration in the southwest include prairie trees, shrublands, and farmland habitats (BISON-M, Schrupp and Cade 1989) \r\n\r\nOn the wintering grounds in Central and South America and Caribbean islands, Ovenbirds generally occupy primary and second growth forests but other habitats are used as well.  Forest types range from dry lowland forests to wet montane forests and include plantations.  They avoid cultivated areas and prefer thick tree cover but will inhabit thickets and scrub habitats in humid and arid regions. \r\n \r\nIn much of its wintering range, this species does not exhibit the area sensitivity observed on the breeding grounds, although they avoid open fields and agricultural areas.  Ovenbirds are found from 61 to 1,067 m (El Salvador), near sea-level to 1,900 m (Guatemala), up to 1,200 m (Jamaica)(Van Horn and Donovan 1994). N.
