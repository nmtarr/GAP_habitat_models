It is adapted for hunting birds and small mammals within dense forests.  Most of the population breeds in boreal forests, but the range extends south into Mexico and Middle America during the summer as well (Bildstein and Meyer 2000).  \r\n\r\nSharp-shinned Hawks nest from sea level to just below alpine conditions in large patches of young, dense, mixed or coniferous woodlands and plantations; most forest types within its range are used during it breeding season (Platt 1976, Reynolds et al. 1982, Meyer 1987, Wiggers and Kritz 1991, Bildstein and Meyer 2000).  Coniferous forest is primarily used in more northern and mountainous portions of their range (AOU 1983).  Where conifers are scarce, as in the prairie regions, cottonwoods, poplars, and other members of the Betulaceae may be used (Bent 1937). Oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) and pine (Pinus) stands are used in Missouri (Bildstein and Meyer 2000).  They are rarely observed outside of continuous patches of forest when breeding (Bildstein and Meyer 2000).  In the West, they are found in douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, aspen, chaparral, and pinyon-juniper forests (Bildstein and Meyer 2000).  They have been seen in mature aspen, conifer, and mixed aspen-conifer (Joy et al. 1994).  However, within mature aspen forests, these hawks nest only in patches of conifers (Joy et al. 1994). In Colorado, they nest in quaking aspen and conifer, particularly in dense stands with a well-developed canopy, and will hunt in mature aspen, conifer-aspen, and conifer forests (Siders and Kennedy 1996, Bildstein and Meyer 2000).  In New Mexico, they nest predominantly in mixed-conifer stands at 2,500-2,640 m (Eakle et al. 1996).  Nests can be placed in Douglas fir trees (Ligon 1961).  In southwestern New Mexico, they can be found in riparian deciduous forest and woodland communities.  \r\n\r\nNests are usually in tree crotch or on branch next to trunk, most often 3-18 m up, hidden by thick foliage (Meyer 1987).  They generally seem to be near a forest opening, though this may reflect observer bias (Bildstein and Meyer 2000).  Sharp-shinned nesting sites were in stands averaging 11.8 ha compared to an average of 4.1 ha for Cooper's hawks in pine stands (Wiggers and Kritz 1991).  An average home range size of 99.5 ha was reported in Schoener (1968).\r\n\r\nSharp-shinned Hawks forage in forests, especially where woodland and open-land matrix exists (Hamel 1992).  They are sometimes found in rural and urban areas near bird feeders (Stevenson and Anderson 1994), and foraging habitat has also been reported as flatwoods, hammocks, mangrove swamp, beaches, interior sand flats, citrus groves, and mixed forest or brush with open areas (Layne et al. 1977).  \r\n\r\nDuring winter, Sharp-shinned Hawks forage in forests, woodlands, pine stands, open areas, and around farms and suburban home sites with bird feeders (Bildstein and Meyer 2000).\r\n\r\nN.
