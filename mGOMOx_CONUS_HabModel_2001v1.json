Honeysuckle, greenbrier and grape vines have been identified as important, but not necessarily essential, vegetative components of habitat - other types of dense brushy vegetation will also do (Webster et al. 1985). However, habitats can vary considerably and may differ to some extent among physiographic regions (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). In the mid and southern Appalachian mountains, it occupies pine stands with greenbrier or mountain laurel thickets, old growth hemlock stands with rhododendron thickets, deciduous stands with an understory of honeysuckle, forested talus slopes and boulder fields, and the forest edges adjacent to old fields, meadows and other open habitats of dense grass and sedge cover (Linzey and Linzey 1971, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). In the coastal plain, it mostly frequents upland habitats but can also be found in swampy woodlands and canebrakes. In AL, it occupies canebrakes and swampy woodlands, or sometimes dry, thickety flatwoods and in FL it may be found in Xeric Upland oak/pine habitats (Whitaker Jr. and Hamilton Jr. 1998).\r\nIt shelters in tree cavities or makes its nest in brushy ground level or above-ground vegetation. Nests and feeding platforms are built on the ground, and above ground in the understory (Frank and Layne 1992). In the coastal plain, nests can be found in the draping Spanish moss of huge live oaks or in brushy thickets (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Young are born in nests that usually are a few inches to 15 feet above ground in bushes and vines (Frank and Layne 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGOMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF04010", "scientific_name": "Ochrotomys nuttalli", "ITIS_TSN": "180379", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101981", "common_name": "Golden Mouse"}}
