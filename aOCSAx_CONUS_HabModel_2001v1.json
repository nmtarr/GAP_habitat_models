They can be found in hardwood and mixed forest and are characteristic inhabitants of spruce-fir forests.  Populations at low elevations are concentrated in or near seepages or streams, whereas those at higher elevations (generally >1370m) are often abundant on the forest floor far from running water (Petranka).  They are most abundant at the edges of escarpments where streams fall to lower elevations and are found less often in streams or seepage in level areas.  Within its range, the salamander occurs at mid and high elevations, but lower elevation limits are not well defined.\r\nLower elevation populations (those generally below 4500 ft) have been found in stream gorges of the Hiwasee, Ocoee, and Tugaloo Rivers, and are closely associated with moist stream and seepage borders (Petranka 1998).  Eggs are laid in wet rock crevices or under rocks, logs, or moss in seepage areas or near small streams.  In western North Carolina, larval period extends 9-10 months (Bruce 1989).  Sexual maturity is attained in 3-4 years in males, 4-5 years in females (Castanet et al. 1996, Herpetologica 52:160-171).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aOCSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03140", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus ocoee", "ITIS_TSN": "550243", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102721", "common_name": "Ocoee Salamander"}}
