Great-tailed grackles prefer semi-open country with scattered large trees for roosting and nesting but can thrive around people; they gather in cities, parks, and farmyards (Jaramillo and Burke 1999).  It is found in open areas with scattered trees and water nearby-pastures, agricultural lands, livestock feedlots, mangroves, and secondary forests (Johnson and Peer 2001).  It is also so attracted to human development: parks, garbage dumps, lawns, streets, campuses, golf courses (Johnson and Peer 2001).  This species can survive in many environments within its range with the exception of dense forests, and areas without water such as empty prairies and deserts (Johnson and Peer 2001).  It will sometimes build nests in oaks (Quercus) in urban environments (Coon et al. 1971), and nests in tamarisks, cottonwoods, and exotic conifers in Arizona (Phillips et al. 1978).  They generally avoid dense woods and forest (Jaramillo and Burke 1999).  \r\n\r\nThis species first appeared in Nevada in the 1970's in the southern part of the state and have recently expanded to the northern part of the state (Alcorn 1988).  In Colorado, this species nests in marshes, evergreen trees, and windbreaks and generally prefers open areas with scattered trees (Kingery 1998).  It will nest in marshes only if there are no available trees or tall shrubs near a water source (Kingery 1998).  In New Mexico, this species nests in marshes or at least near water (Ligon 1961).  In the lower Colorado River Valley of Arizona, this species prefers to be in tall trees in association with human residences close to water (Rosenberg et al. 1991).   It inhabits chaparral of Lower Rio Grande Valley, live oaks and cedar elms within central and southeastern Texas, bulrush marsh in shallow lakes near the Gulf Coast, salt marshes, and lakeside cane brakes (Johnson and Peer 2001).  Occurs at 0 - 2,300 meters Johnson and Peer (2001) reported that this species nests up to 2,300 m while Kingery (1998) reported that it nests up to 2,400 m in Colorado.  N.
