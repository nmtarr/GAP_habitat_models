Hist., Raleigh, North Carolina. 72 pp."}, "habitat_description": "The highest abundance of southern flying squirrels are found in mast-producing forests (oak or hickory as constituents), but seeds from many other trees, including conifers, are suitable forage (Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  They are found in mature hardwood & mixed conifer-hardwood forests, including in urban and rural areas, and they will also use old orchards.  In south Florida, they also use pinelands, hammock, swamp, coastal shrub, and bayhead (Fernald 1989; Layne 1984; Moore 1947).  They primarily nest in tree cavities, but will use birdhouses, attics, and abandoned leaf nests. Burt (1940) found that flying squirrels ranged over 3.72 acres of a wood plot.  Gestation lasts about 40 days and births peak in late February-March and September-October.  Litter size usually is about 2-3 with two litters per year (Stapp and Mautz 1991).
