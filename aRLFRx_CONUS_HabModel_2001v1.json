Also in Virgin River Valley, Washington County, extreme southwest Utah and northwest Arizona. Found also along the Virgin River and its lower Muddy River tributary in Clark County Nevada into the Colorado River to Black Canyon area found below Boulder Dam (Behler and King 1979; Stebbins 2003). \r\n\r\nIn Arizona, this protected species is found in ponds, rivers, streams, springs, and wetlands of the Mojave Desertscrub (Brennan and Holycross 2009).\r\n\r\nFound along lowland streams and springs surrounded by deserts (Stebbins 2003). Most localities are wetlands below 600 meters (Linsdale 1940), which are wetlands adjacent to the Virgin River and in one reported wetland next to the Colorado River in an area presently inundated by Lake Mead (Cowles and Bogert 1936).  The area around Overton Arm of Lake Mead consists of fast flowing streams fed by geothermal springs; the soil at the sites is gypsiferous and sustains dense emergent vegetation. The area inhabited by this species in the Black Canyon are also geothermal springs that flow over relatively rockier substrates that sustain Tamarix sp. And mesquite. Temperatures at this sites are constant (Lannoo 2005). Habitat also includes spring seeps and bulrush stands usually found along marshes and pools (Behler and King 1979). Breeding habitats resemble adult habitat and includes slow moving streams, with or without vegetation (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRLFRx", "ELCode": "AAABH01150", "scientific_name": "Lithobates onca", "ITIS_TSN": "775105", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106274", "common_name": "Relict Leopard Frog"}}
