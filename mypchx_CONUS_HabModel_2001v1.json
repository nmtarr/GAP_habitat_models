In Sierra Nevada of NV and CA, \u201cin conifer forests around chaparral, logs, and rocks\u201d (Storer and Usinger 1963). In California,  \u201c... open stands of most coniferous forest habitats, montane hardwood, montane hardwood-conifer, pinyon-juniper, and many great Basin shrub habitats (CDFG 2003). Also in California, \u201cWidespread in all pine and fir forests from ponderosa pine to lodgepole pine...... most abundant in ponderosa pine forests (Verner and Boss 1980). Elevation range \u201cin California extends from about 975 m to timberline at about 2,900 m (Johnson, 1943)\u201d (Sutton 1992). In Sierra Nevada, \u201c4400-9400 feet\u201d (1341-2865 m) (Storer and Usinger 1963). Wilson and Ruff (1999) quote an elevation range from about 950 m to 2800 m.\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn central Oregon, Verts and Carraway (1998) describe T. amoenus habitat as \"open juniper-ponderosa pine forests with understories of big sagebrush and rabbit-brush; ponderosa pine with scattered lodgepole pine forest with understories of bitter-brush; and open ponderosa pine forests with dense patches of piine regeneration and some replacement of ponderosa pine by Douglas-fir and with understories of tobacco-brush and manzanita. Both in this region [central OR] and elsewhere in the state, ponderosa pine seems to be the common factor in habitats occupied by the species (Bailey 1936). Nevertheless, individual T. amoenus occasionally range short distances from the forest edge into shrub-steppe communities; at one locality, 30% of captures in shrub-stepped were >130 m from the forest edge, but at another site, noe was as far as 130 m (States 1976)\".", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mYPCHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02030", "scientific_name": "Tamias amoenus", "ITIS_TSN": "180190", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103853", "common_name": "Yellow-pine Chipmunk"}}
