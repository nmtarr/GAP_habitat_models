Adaptable to many aquatic environments, nutrias may be found in brackish or freshwater marshes, swamps, lakes and ponds where they nest in vegetation in shallow water.  They inhabit lakes, bayous, rivers, marshes, and  runoff ponds and agricultural canals, using a broad variety of aquatic environments. The Florida panhandle colonies apparently resulted from the eastward expansion of populations along the Gulf Coast that originated in the Louisiana marshes. Exceedingly abundant in barnyard runoff canals and polluted holding ponds maintained by several large dairies in the Tampa Bay area. Capable of living and thriving at unusually high population numbers in nutrient-rich cattle sewage lagoons. Observed feeding heavily on the water hyacinths and in some limited areas partially decimated them (Brown 1975). They live in freshwater or slightly brackish water and are adaptable to many aquatic environments which have emergent, floating , or submergent vegetation (Brown 1997). Trani et al. describe habitat in the South as: \"Throughout the South, most significant populations inhabit coastal salt marshes, brackish tidal marshes, and estuaries, but they also inhabit a diversity of freshwater habitats  including marshes, ponds, lakes, and rivers (Atwood 1950, Milne and Quay 1967, Chabreck 1970, Willner et al. 1979, Linscombe et al. 1981, Nichols and Chabreck 1981, Linscombe and Kinler 1984, Kinler et al. 1987). Nutria occur in the margins of bodies of water where there is abundant aquatic and semiaquatic vegetation. Burrows are constructed in the steep banks, under exposed roots and trees, and in masses of collapsed vegetation.\"\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Oregon, Verts and Carraway (1998) describe brackish and freshwater aquatic habitats adjacent to rivers, lakes, sloughs, marshes, ponds, and temporarily flooded fields (during winter) with vegetation associations including false loosestrife, nodding beggar-ticks, Oregon ash, creeping spike-rush, simplestem bur-reed, bentgrass, willow, and speedwell.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCOYPx", "ELCode": "AMAFK01010", "scientific_name": "Myocastor coypus", "ITIS_TSN": "180402", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102549", "common_name": "Coypu"}}
