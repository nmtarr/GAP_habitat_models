Its distribution includes large gaps towards the in prairie and south portions of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio (Conant and Collins 1998).\r\nFound in the cool, clear waters of the north; rocky ravines, sphagnum moss, and meadow streams. However, in the south, it is found in warm, turbid, tea-colored waters across the Coastal Plain and floodplains. Found also in grassy fields and weed-covered areas during the summer. Can also be located in the twilight zones of caves (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding occurs adjacent to adult habitat such as woodland ponds and pools, farm ponds, sinkhole ponds, floodplain wetlands, marshes, stream overflow pools, quarries, and flooded marshes (Lannoo 2005). An important detail is that oviposition occurs more often in eutrophic zones than it does in oligotrophic ones, attached to vegetation in microhabitat with the most light penetrance (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aPIFRx", "ELCode": "AAABH01160", "scientific_name": "Lithobates palustris", "ITIS_TSN": "775107", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101857", "common_name": "Pickerel Frog"}}
