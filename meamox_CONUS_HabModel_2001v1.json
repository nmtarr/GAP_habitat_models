They can also be found in sandy pineland, flatwoods, waste areas, dunes, scrub, and hammocks (Fernald 1989; Layne 1984; Ivey 1959; Moore 1946).  They are very localized and rare in the mountains, where they are restricted to river bottoms and low-lying habitats (Webster et al. 1985).  Loose sandy to loamy soils are a key habitat feature (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998) and they are often absent from saturated muck or peat soils (Brown 1997).  Moles are fossorial mammals and spend most of their lives in an underground system of tunnels.  The breeding season is March-April. Gestation lasts 42-45 days. Litter size is 2-5 with one litter per year.  They reach sexual maturity within 1 year and few live more than 4 years (Davis and Choate 1993).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe eastern mole\u2019s western limit is Colorado and Wyoming (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). General habitat is open areas with moist soils, such as lawns, meadows, and golf courses (NatureServe).  Bottomland wooded areas also are utilized (NatureServe). This fossorial species appears to be limited to well-developed, well-drained soils of floodplains and sandhills in northeastern and extreme southeastern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  The eastern mole is active year-round, and spends an estimated 99% of its life below ground (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Moles are most numerous in loose, loamy or sandy soils that are sufficiently moist for tunneling (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Prefers moist, loamy or sandy soils and is scarce or absent in heavy clay, stony or gravelly soils; exceedingly moist or dry areas are often avoided by these animals and are absent altogether from arid lands (Yates and Schmidly 1978).  S. aquaticus is highly subterranean and avoid soil types that are too wet or dry (Hartman and Yates 2003).  Eastern moles have two types of underground passageways: near-surface and deep (NatureServe). Surface passageways are commonly seen with their raised ridges; deep (10-24\") provide wintering/breeding areas (NatureServe). Den sites often are located under protection of a surface object (NatureServe).  The home range for males averages 1.9 ha, and females averaged 0.28 ha based on research by Harvey (Harvey 1976).  Home range varies from 0.5-4.5 acres (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981).  Moles feed mostly on invertebrates, especially earthworms and insects (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Elevational range from CWSD.\r\n\r\nNortheast:\r\nIn the Northeast, this species can be found in open woodlands, meadows, pasture/open fields, and residential areas with well-drained, sandy and/or loamy soils.
