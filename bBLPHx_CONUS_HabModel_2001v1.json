Coastal cliffs, riverbanks, the shorelines of lakes and ephemeral ponds, cattle tanks, and fountains in parks are all favored habitats (Wolf 1997). Feeds almost entirely on flying insects (Wolf 1997). Is usually found near water, nesting on cliffs, under bridges and eaves and sometimes inside buildings (American Ornithologists' Union 1983). In Arizona: Breeds along permanent canals and streams, but is not a resident (according to Monson and Phillips 1981). Distribution is limited to the southern half of the state, confined largely to water courses and irrigation projects (Ligon 1961). Vertical surface for nesting that is protected from rain, near a mud source, and preferably near water is necessary (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Occurs in a variety of open and wooded habitats, usually near water, especially in drier regions (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Found in the vicinity of streams, canals, lake margins, reservoirs, or other riparian sites flanked by grasslands, scattered trees, open woodlands or farmland (DeGraaf et al. 1991). During migration and in winter, found at almost any source of water (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Will build nests under projecting roofs (Holland 1923). Has been observed to fish in a sewage pond near Henderson, NV (Lawson 1975).\r\nForages in open areas over water, grass, and other substrates. Elevation ranges from sea level to 3,000 m (Willet 1912, Howell and Webb 1995). Almost any semipermanent source of water with an accompanying source of mud, required for nest construction, is attractive to this species. In many areas, natural nest sites, such as sheltered rock faces, streamside boulders, and hollow cavities in trees, have largely given way to artificial nest sites provided by human-made structures (quoted directly from Wolf 1997).\r\nA common to abundant, yearlong resident of riparian habitats in cismontane California. Found in valley foothill, montane, and desert riparian habitats, usually below 1200 m (4000 ft), but has been found up to 2700 m (9000 ft) after breeding season (Grinnell and Miller 1944). In the north, breeds east to Siskiyou Co. (McCaskie et al. 1979). A rare, local breeder in desert riparian areas, and a regular winter visitant to southern interior lowlands. There is a summer population east of the Sierra Nevada north as far as Bishop (Inyo Co.) (Grinnell and Miller 1944). Resident on Channel Islands (Garrett and Dunn 1981), and rare to uncommon on Farallon Islands, fall through spring (DeSante and Ainley 1980). Closely tied to streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, agricultural ditches, sewage ponds, bays, tidepools, almost any body of water (quoted directly from Green et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1989).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBLPHx", "ELCode": "ABPAE35010", "scientific_name": "Sayornis nigricans", "ITIS_TSN": "178330", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103376", "common_name": "Black Phoebe"}}
