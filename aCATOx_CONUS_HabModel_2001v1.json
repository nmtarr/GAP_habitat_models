Its range expands from northwest Minnesota and northeast South Dakota into the eastern half of Alberta and extreme south District of Mack (Conant and Collins 1998).  Separate population found in southeast Wyoming (Behler and King 1979).\r\nFound in prairies and aspen parklands usually near water. Uses lakes, ponds, marshes, potholes, streams, roadside ditches where breeding is suitable. Found in the Fort Smith area of the northwest territory of Canada, northeast South Dakota to northwest Minnesota (Stebbins 2003). Adult toads utilize habitats found in mesic, but not completely arid savannas and prairies. Individuals can be found in pothole wetlands, irrigation ditches, and flooded fields. Prefer an aspen parkland country which is characterized by having trees interspersed with grassland. In contrast, in Alberta, toads are reportedly more abundant in areas of willow bog or grass than areas of aspen or spruce (Lannoo 2005). Found in margins of ponds, lakes, and potholes (Behler and King 1979).\r\n\r\nAspen parkland country which is characterized by having trees interspersed with grassland.
