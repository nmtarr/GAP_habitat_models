They prefer grasslands, sagebrush plains, deserts and foothills. There is a need for free water with succulent vegetation in their diet. The species inhabits the areas of previous prescribed burns very well. Pronghorns inhabit grasslands and semidesert shrublands on rolling topography that affects good visibility. They are most adundant in short grass or midgrass prairie and less common in xeric habitats. The following characteristics were found on preferred ranges: 1 - ground cover averaged 50% living vegetation; 2 - general composition was 40-60% grass, 10-30% forbs, 5-20% browse; 3 - within the vegetative community there was a variety of species often including 5-10 species of grasses, 20-40 species of forbs, 5-10 species of shrubs; 4 - succulent plants were preferred; 5 - open rangelands with a variety of vegetative types were preferred to menotypic communities; 6 - vegetation averages 15 inches in height, those with vegetation over 30 inches are infrequently used. Pronghorns are residents of bushy grasses and sagebrush flats. Pronghorn is one of mammals typical of Plains-Mesa Grassland which occurs below the Savanna Zone. This grassland is dominated by species such as blue grama, buffalograss, galleta, and dropseed and includes tobosa grass and sacaton in swales. Pronghorn is also associated with Great Basin Desert Scrub in northwestern portion of New Mexico and is dominated by shrubs including big sagebrush and fourwing saltbush with sparse ground cover. Pronghorn occupy shortgrass to midgrass, mixed grass-shrub, and desert habitats. Within these habitats, population numbers are highest when annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 38 cm. The species is common in Utah, where it primarily occurs in desert, grassland, and sagebrush habitats (UDWR, 2003). In Arizona, this species had a good, viable population along the Bill Williams River and north into the valley where Lake Havasu City now stands (Blair 2005). In 1963, at the founding of Lake Havasu City, they shifted their range south to the Aubry Hills and then up the north side of the Bill Williams River (Blair 2005). They continued shifting east toward the Castanada Wash area and the Black Mesa Wilderness (Blair 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPRONs", "ELCode": "AMALD01012", "scientific_name": "Antilocapra americana sonoriensis", "ITIS_TSN": "180717", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104902", "common_name": "Sonoran Pronghorn"}}
