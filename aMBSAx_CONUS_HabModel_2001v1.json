In bottomland areas, both conifer and deciduous forests are apparently used (Harrison 1978, Behler and King 1979). In Virginia, breeds in fish-free vernal pond in a large clearcut area and in ephemeral sinkhole ponds up to 1.5 m deep, within bottomland hardwood forest mixed with pine (Mitchell 1991).  Adults usually remain near breeding water bodies (Petranka 1998). They can sometimes be found buried at the bottom of dried seasonal pools (Hardy 1969). Water bodies that contain fish are less favorable for offspring survival than are fish-free waters (Wilson 1995). Therefore, small water bodies and seasonal ponds are often used for breeding.  Threats include drainage of breeding sites, other hydrological alterations that may affect breeding sites, and urbanization and forestry practices that destroy or degrade nonbreeding habitat (Mitchell 1991). Many breeding sites have been lost through draining of wetlands and conversion of forests into croplands (Petranka 1998).  Moves to breeding sites in fall and winter (North Carolina), breeds late fall to early spring. Eggs are laid singly or in loose chains of 2-6 eggs. Eggs hatch in 9-14 days. Metamorphosis to the terrestrial form occurs in April and May. Aggregates when breeding.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aMBSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01070", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma mabeei", "ITIS_TSN": "173600", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101261", "common_name": "Mabee's Salamander"}}
