American Society fo Mammalogists, Mammalian Species No. 838:1-14."}, "habitat_description": "Southwest:\r\nP. boylii occurs in interior chaparral, plains grassland, scrub-grassland, and warm temperate swamp and riparian forests (Thompson et al. 1996). It may forage in pastures and orchards adjacent to scrub oak cover (Thompson et al. 1996). In southern New Mexico, the species is abundant in encinal/live oak woodlands in canyon bottoms, hillsides and arroyos in the grasslands, though in arid parts it is found on north slopes with pinyon, juniper, oak, beargrass, and dasylirions (Thompson et al. 1996). It also likes rocky areas mixed with open forests of junipers, pinyon pine and blue oak (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It is rarely found in mixed coniferous forest (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). In Arizona, it occurs in juniper or juniper and pinyon, oaks, scrub oaks on flats or steep slopes, riparian and wash areas, grapevine-covered slopes, around buildings, and in caves and mines (Hoffmeister 1986). P. boylii is found among aspen, cottonwood, willow, pinyon-juniper,  western live oak, Gambel's oak, gray oak, Emory oak, Toumey's oak, winter-fat, creosotebush, Apache plume, fourwinged saltbush, sagebrush, sycamore, rabbitbrush, tarbush, ocotillo, mountain mahogany, redberry juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, grama and buffalograss, galleta, ricegrass, beargrass, alder, netleaf hackberry, mesquite, saltcedar, walnut, and Ceanothus species (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954, Findley 1975, Jameson, Jr. and Peeters 1988, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It occasionally occurs in ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, bristlecone pine, and limber pine (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Dense, shrubby vegetation is important; oakbrush cover is most favorable (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It also lives in caves and mines, and it often occurs with Neotoma species' and uses their dens as cover (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). P. boylii eats manzanita berries, mistletoe, and prickly pear cactus (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The elevation is 610-3,049m and was compiled from the highest and lowest elevations from capture records in Hoffmeister (1986) and  Hall (1995).  The home range is 0.09ha (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found at all aspects. The species is found on mountains and mountain slopes across Arizona, except for the southwest (Hoffmeister 1986). The brush mouse occurs in southeast and southwest Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs where Washoe, Carson, and Douglas counties meet and in the southernmost part of Nevada (Hall 1995). It is found throughout New Mexico except on the Llano Estacado (Frey 2004). It occurs across east and south Utah (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997). The range was created using Anderson 1972, Findley 1975, Hoffmeister 1986, Zeveloff 1988, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Hall 1995,  Frey 2004, and previous data from Colorado GAP, NatureServe, New Mexico GAP, and Utah GAP. Can be found in the following mountain ranges: Peloncillo Mountains; Animas Mountains; Cerrillos Hills; Sandia Mountains; Florida Mountains; Huachuca Mountains; Guadalupe Mountains; Zuni Mountains; Hualapai Mountains; San Francisco Mountains; Weaver Mountains; Juniper Mountains; Bradshaw Mountains; Harquahala Mountains; Sierra Ancha; Mazatzal Mountains; Pinaleno Mountains; Gila Mountains; Santa Rita Mountains; Santa Catalina Mountains; Baboquivari Mountains; Pajarito Mountains; Patagonia Mountains; Chiricahua Mountains; Big Hatchet Mountains; Carson Range. In California this species is absent from coastal areas north of Monterey Bay, the Central Valley, eastern Sierra Nevada and the Mojave Desert. Preferred habitats include mesic environments with abundant ground cover, shrub canopies with rocky outcrops and piles within oak woodlands, riparian, valley foothill mixed forest/woodlands and montane chaparral (Brylski et al. 2005 based Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, this species' range was formerly attributed to include the Llano Estacado and Panhandle regions, however, Schmidly (2004) notes that these records were later identified as P. attwateri by Larry Choate of Texas Tech Unviersity. They are usually associated with stream banks, rocky areas such as talus slopes, and open pine-fir forests in and around natural cavities among brush piles and downed logs (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBRDEx", "ELCode": "AMAFF03100", "scientific_name": "Peromyscus boylii", "ITIS_TSN": "180282", "Global_SEQ_ID": "784076", "common_name": "Brush Deermouse"}}
