Other populations occur at higher elevations, 945-1430 meters (Green et al. 2013), on the northern slopes of the Tehachapi Mountains from Tejon Canyon to Fort Tejon (Stebbins 1985; Jockusch 1996; Wake 1996; Wake and Jockusch 2000). It is important to note than only one specimen has been reported from Black Mountain near Tehachapi Pass in between the populations of the Tehachapi Mountains and Caliente Canyon (Brame and Murray 1968). \r\nThe habitat in Caliente Canyon can be described as moderately arid; Individuals are found restricted to the north-facing slopes in the lower margins of Caliente Creek, small side canyons, in limestone talus and scattered rocks. Dominant vegetation includes interior live oak, blue oak, Fremont cottonwood, California buckeye, foothill pine, and sycamore (Brame and Murray 1968). In the more exposed localities, characterized by sandy-gravelly loam to decomposed granite, vegetation consists of yucca, bush alpine, buckwheats, and California juniper. Similarly, in the Tehachapi Mountains, salamanders are also restricted to north-facing slopes except at higher elevations and almost exclusively associated with fallen wood or talus rather than rocks. \r\n\r\nDominant vegetation includes interior live oak, blue oak, Fremont cottonwood, California buckeye, foothill pine, and sycamore (Brame and Murray 1968).
