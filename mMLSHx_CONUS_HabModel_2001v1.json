Lyell Shrew (Sorex lyelli) is a poorly known species found in high montane and cold steppe communites on the central and eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevadas (Zeiner et al. 2008).   Fewer than 40 individuals have been found; three were found at Mammoth Lakes and nine in the Sweetwater Mountains (Epanchin and Engilis, Jr. 2009).  The highest-elevation individual was found at Frog Lake in Fresno County, CA at 3,630 m (Epanchin and Engilis, Jr. 2009).  Documented habitats include wetlands, wet meadows, sagebrush-steppe, sparsely vegetated alpine meadow with rocks and boulders, and grassy streamsides with willows (Epanchin and Engilis, Jr. 2009).  In Yosemite National Park, they show a strong affinity for grassy meadows near fast-flowing water with willow thickets.  At all capture locations, there have been grasses present and a water source nearby (river, wet meadow, lake, wetland; Epanchin and Engilis 2009).  N.
