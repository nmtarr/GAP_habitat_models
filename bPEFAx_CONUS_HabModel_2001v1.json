Also reported to nest on river banks, tundra mounds, open bogs, large stick nests of other species, tree hollows, and man-made structures (e.g., ledges of city buildings) are used locally in North Carolina (Cade 1982).  They are common along seacoasts (AOU 1983), prefer open areas, mudflats, dunes, ponds, lakes and marshes, extensive fields (Hamel 1992).  Peregrines commonly feed on shorebirds, waterfowl, and wading birds (Layne et al. 1977).  Optimum habitat in Florida is on coasts in regions with regenerating mangroves.  Also impoundments and marshy lakes (Kale 1978).  Occasionally inhabits cities, nesting on ledges, feeding on pigeons (Kaufman 1996).  Peregrines forages over open areas, and at times in or near forests (Hamel 1992).  Rare in the mountains (Simpson 1992). Although hacked birds and their descendants breed sporadically at high elevation (Hamel 1992).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe Peregrine Falcon can be found throughout most of the Southwest GAP region. It is more commonly found in Arizona and Colorado (AGFD 2002, Andrews and Righter 1992, BISON-M). The Peregrine is still rare in Utah, but has become more abundant in recent years throughout its range (UDWR 2004). In Nevada and New Mexico, the Peregrine is also a rare transient species (Alcorn 1988, BISON-M). Found statewide in New Mexico in winter but uncommon (Ligon 1961).\r\nThe Peregrine Falcon prefers breeding in a variety of habitats. These habitats range from tundra to plains habitats with cliffs for nesting sites (Andrews and Righter 1992, NatureServe 2003). This species will build theirs nest using a variety of structures such as on river banks, rock outcroppings, human structures, and cliffs near foraging areas in coniferous or deciduous woodlands (Andrews and Righter 1992, NatureServe 2003, Schrupp and Cade 1989). Arizona\u2019s breeding Peregrines are near cliffs in areas with sufficient prey including the Mogollon Rim, Grand Canyon, and Colorado Plateau (AGFD 2002). In Colorado a few Peregrines breed along the foothills, but the majority nest in the river valleys and canyons of the Western Slope (Kingery 1998).  Non-breeding Peregrines are often found close to prey sources near reservoirs, rivers, and marshes (Andrews and Righter 1992, NatureServe). \r\nDuring migration and in wintering areas, the Peregrine Falcon can be found in grassland and agricultural areas of eastern Colorado and in other areas of Colorado in  pinyon-juniper and ponderosa forest habitats, perhaps because these forests are often found close to cliffs and provide hunting grounds (Schrupp and Cade, 1989).\r\nThe data for the range in elevation is taken from White et al. 2002 and AGFD 2002.  In Arizona, the Peregrine can be found from 122m to 2743m (AGFD 2002).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nThis species may breed to 3600 m in the Rocky Mountains. In the Pacific Northwest, enormous numbers of a few marine bird species support one of the densest-known Peregrine populations (White et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nMexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) regularly hunted at dawn and dusk at mouths of roosting caves on Edwards Plateau, TX (Stager 1941, Skutch 1951, Lee and Kuo 2001)(quoted directly from White et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bPEFAx", "ELCode": "ABNKD06070", "scientific_name": "Falco peregrinus", "ITIS_TSN": "175604", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102654", "common_name": "Peregrine Falcon"}}
