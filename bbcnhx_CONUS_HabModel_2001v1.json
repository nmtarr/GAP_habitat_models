They forage along the water\u2019s edge or in shallow areas and nest in colonies built on dense woods, groves of shrubs, tall trees, reeds, cattails, or thickets near salt, brackish, or fresh water bodies (Hamel 1992, Davis 1997).  Most breeding colonies are associated with large wetlands (Davis 1993) and are on islands, in swamps, or over water (Hothem et al. 2010).  Nests are placed in one of a variety of vegetation types including trees, shrubs, vines, reeds, cattails, and bulrush and may even be placed on the remnants of buildings or on the ground (Hothem et al. 2010).  Some populations are migratory but they exhibit the same habitat associations on their wintering grounds as they do on breeding grounds.\r\n\r\nBlack-crowned Night Herons are present all over the Southwest around brackish marshes and  even saltwater.  They are generally rare to accidental in montane parks, but much more common and widespread in prairie and semiarid areas of the Rocky Mountains region, wherever suitable habitat occurs.  They are likely to be associated with shallow bulrush or cattail marshes, often well away from woodlands (Johnsgard 1992).  They are a common summer resident in Utah, where nesting colonies are normally established in marshes along lakes in northern part of state.  They are sensitive to human disturbance and habitat degradation, especially during breeding season (Utah Conservation Data).  They are summer residents throughout Nevada and winter residents in its western and southern parts.  They are fairly common permanent residents in brushy riparian sites along the Colorado River (Alcorn 1988).  They are residents in the middle and lower Rio Grande and lower Pecos Valley.  The species is generally observed in association with shoreline and marsh habitats that border open water (BISON-M 2000).  Black-crowned Night-Herons are common to abundant spring and fall migrants and summer residents locally in North Park, San Luis Valley, and on the eastern plains of Colorado. They are rare in Colorado\u2019s western valley.   Most breeding colonies are in San Luis Valley and on the northeastern plains. They are rare spring and fall migrants in Middle and South Park and in foothills and lower mountains outside parks. They are uncommon winter residents locally in western valleys in Mesa and Delta Cos., in San Luis Valley at Monte Vista NWR, Rio Grande CO. and on the eastern plains near the foothills.  Breeding colonies are usually in willows or other shrubs near ponds and marshes.  Most winter birds are found along rivers (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Edited by N.
