It occurs in the Pecos River valley in New Mexico from Texas to Carlsbad and Roswell (Bailey 1971).  \r\n\r\nMexican Ground Squirrels inhabit level grasslands associated with mesquite, creosote, acacia, cacti, or shrubs; gardens; grainfields;  tobosa-burrograss  tobosa-mesquite, and tobosa-Opuntia associations; shortgrass-yucca; shortgrass-juniper associations;  pastures; golf courses; and cemeteries (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).   It will also inhabitat grasslands with scattered oak trees (Young and Jones, Jr. 1982).\r\n\r\nSlope and soil characteristics appear to be important for this species.  In Terrell County, TX it was only found on mesa tops of the Stockton Plateau vegetated with cedar-savannah habitat; not in canyons or on mesa slopes (Young and Jones, Jr. 1982).  It prefers sandy and gravelly soils and avoids rocky areas (Thompson et al. 1996). \r\n\r\nThese ground squirrels eat mesquite beans, pods and leaves, agarita leaves and berries, Shasta lily, grain, corn, melons, Johnson grass, pin clover, and other seeds and beans (NatureServe 2001, Bailey 1971, Davis and David 1994).  Their home range usually does not exceed 90m in diameter and is normally half this size (NatureServe 2014).  In Texas, the home range is about 45m in radius (Davis and Schmidly 1994). Elevation is from 210 to 3,230 meters (Young and Jones, Jr. 1982). Burrow depth ranges from 30 to 125cm (Young and Jones, Jr. 1982). N.
