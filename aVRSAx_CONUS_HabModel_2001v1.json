They can be found under rocks, logs, and other surface cover along ravines and mountain slopes (Green and Pauley 1987, Petranka 1998, Beamer and Lannoo 2005).  They are sometimes found in the twilight zones of West Virginia caves (Petranka 1998). The majoity of sites inhabited by P. hoffmani are dry and well drained (Highton 1999, Beamer and Lannoo 2005). They have been collected from sites as high as 1402 meters (Pauley 1980, Petranka 1998). Courtship and mating probably occur in spring. A clutch of 3-8 eggs is laid in spring.  The larval stage is passed in the egg and the female attends the clutch. Hatching occurs in August-September and sexual maturity is reached in 2-3 years.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aVRSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12080", "scientific_name": "Plethodon hoffmani", "ITIS_TSN": "173657", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100062", "common_name": "Valley And Ridge Salamander"}}
