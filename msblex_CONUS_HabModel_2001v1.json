North American Fauna 50:1-38."}, "habitat_description": "The Southern Bog Lemming (Synaptomys cooperi) prefers bog, fen, marsh and wet meadow conditions with thick cover of grasses, sedges, or shrubs throughout its range (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998, Jones Jr. and Birney 1988). However, it will use a variety of open habitats, including dry grassy hillsides, tall grass fields, grassy areas interspersed with short-tree and shrubby growth, canebrakes, grassy clearings in woods, orchards and forest edges adjacent to meadows and old fields (Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Green, succulent monocot grasses and sedges are a consistent and perhaps critical component of habitat (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). It makes its den under mats of grass and sphagnum, in brushy thickets and in areas of thick leaf mold and humus. Burrow-like runways through the dense grass are similar to those made by species of in the genus Microtus.  There has been some evidence that Synaptomys only occurs where it is not excluded by Microtus species (Linzey 1983).  In upland settings, it may use open grassy areas as well as mesic, partially open to closed conifer, deciduous and mixed forests with a thick humus layer (Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). However, in drier forests of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, sphagnum bogs with tall grasses and sedges are the principal habitat (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Occupation of drier habitat may result when populations get too large to exist solely in more mesic habitat (Jones. and Birney 1988).  It is not restricted to bogs in Kansas; it also inhabits plant communities with thick, matted ground cover with high overhead vegetation in forests and grasslands, and their distribution is centered around springs, damp to wet grasslands, and marshes (Kansas Mammal Atlas 2015).  In the prairie and Great Lakes regions, it inhabits grasslands and possibly areas with shrubs (Linzey 1983).  Most captures in the East are associated with sphagnum bogs or heavily forested areas (Linzey 1983).  In the southern Appalachians, it is found in bogs, dry broomsedge fields, pastures, grassy openings in woods, power-line rights-of-way, clearcuts, and in rocky areas of spruce forests (Linzey 1983). In Missouri, it prefers heavy stands of bluegrass in low, moist locations, but also inhabits swamps, bogs, and damp woods with leaf litter (Schwartz and Schwartz 2001).  In Adirondacks, this species is known to occur between 244-1341 m in elevation (Saunders 1988).  It is restricted to relatively high elevations in the southern Appalachians (Linzey 1983).  N.
