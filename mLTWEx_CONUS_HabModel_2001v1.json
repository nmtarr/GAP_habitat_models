It is commonly associated with water features and ecotones on the landscape, but its distribution is also heavily influenced spatially and temporally by prey abundance (Sheffield and Thomas 1997).   \r\n\r\nReported habitats include chestnut oak forest, scrub oak-pitch pine forest (in Pennsylvania), cattail marsh (Ontario), regenerating clear cuts in the East with dense tree sprouts, late seral and ecotones in Manitoba, and dense brush in or along dry creeks and drainages (Kentucky).\r\nThey forage along the borders of pastures and old fields.  However, when M. erminea are present, they partition habitat.  Sheffield and Thomas (1997) reported that they tend to forage more within forests in these situations, but Zeveloff (1988) reported that M. frenata is more common in open habitats when competition between these two species occurs (Zeveloff 1988).  \r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, M. frenata is found in forest edges and relatively open forests (Thompson et al. 1996).  Habitat use is associated with free-standing water and is a limiting factor in drier desert ecozones (Hall 1995, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  The species generally avoids wet habitats in New Mexico, though it may be found in riparian ecosystems (Thompson et al. 1996).  Elsewhere, favored habitats include field edges, brushland and open woodlands, riparian grasslands, swamps, and marshes (NatureServe 2001, Bailey 1971).  It also occurs on tundra, alpine and subalpine grasslands, plains grassland, scrub-grassland, and desert scrub (Thompson et al. 1996). This species is found among aspen, cottonwood-willow, mountain mahogany, pinyon-juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oak, encinal oak, mountain scrub, chaparral, sagebrush, rabbitbrush, grama and buffalograss (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Distribution probably depends more on prey species availability than on vegetation or topography (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Any prey species small enough to be subdued is eaten (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Size of the home range varies with habitat, population density, season, sex, and food availability (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Can be found in the following mountain ranges: -Sangre de Christo Mountains; Jemez Mountains; Mogollon Mountains; Sandia Mountains; Chuska Mountains; Lukachukai Mountains; White Mountains; San Francisco Mountains; Antelope Range; Blue Range; Chiricahua Mountains; Black Hills; Carson Range; Pine Forest Range; Calico Mountains; Cottonwood Mountains; Toquima Range; Ruby Mountains\r\n\r\nLong-tailed Weasels may be found in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Southeast.  They are frequently found near water, but they may occupy every type of terrestrial community from forested to open habitats (GA-GAP). This weasel can be found, perhaps primarily, near wet sites such as swamps, marshes and water courses, especially where brushy thickets reach the waterline (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Other haunts include most woodland habitats, sparsely wooded second-growth forests, brushy areas, stream banks, and the borders of forests and fields (Lowman 1975, Lee et al. 1982, Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLTWEx", "ELCode": "AMAJF02030", "scientific_name": "Mustela frenata", "ITIS_TSN": "180556", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100836", "common_name": "Long-tailed Weasel"}}
