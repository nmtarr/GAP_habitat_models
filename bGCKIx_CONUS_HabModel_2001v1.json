These habitats include mixed coniferous-deciduous forests, single-species stands, pine plantations, and spruce-fir forests among others (Hamel 1992).  They prefer coniferous forests, usually dense and mature stands but will nest in forests with closed or open canopies, edges of clearings, logged or burned areas, and forests with dense or no understory (Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996, Ingold and Galati 1997).  Nests are frequently placed in balsam fir, white spruce, and black spruce trees and are usually attached to twigs of a horizontal branch of a spruce or other conifer (Ehrlich et al 1988, Harrison 1975, Kaufman 1996, Potter et al. 1980).  The hanging nest is a mass of moss, lichens, bark strips, spider webs, twigs, and leaves (Ehrlich et al 1988, Kaufman 1996).  Foraging Golden-crowned Kinglets actively hop among branches, twigs, and foliage searching for small insects, larvae, insect eggs, and other small invertebrates (Kaufman 1996).  In addition to hopping, they also hover and glean at times (Ehrlich et al 1988).\r\n\r\nIn northern Maine, they breed in spruce-fir forests and numbers increase with amount of softwood overstory and size. In New York, they breed in pine, mixed pine and spruce, balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and hemlock (Tsuga) groves, bogs with conifers, scattered evergreen trees or groves in parks or cemeteries, and conifer (spruce or mixed spruce-pine) plantations as small as 1 ha.  In West Virginia they can be found in spruce forests with trees that are over 10 m tall.  They are also found in mixed spruce\u2013northern hardwood and pine plantations (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nIn northern Minnesota they nest in mixed forest stands dominated by balsam fir, white spruce (Picea glauca), red pine (Pinus resinosa), and some tamarack (Larix laricina), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), aspen (Populus tremuloides), and Jack pine (Pinus banksiana) where the understory is composed of Bebb\u2019s willow (Salix bebbiana), bog birch (Betula pumila), red osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), or speckled alder (Alnus rugosa).  They also breed in bogs dominated by black spruces (Picea mariana) around 20 m tall and with tamaracks around the edges. In South Dakota, they nest in spruce and occasionally pine forests.  In Michigan, they can be found in bogs containing white cedar (Thuja occidentalis; Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nThey are residents in eastern Nevada in the Snake Range but are irregular visitors over the rest of the state (Alcorn 1988).  In Arizona, Golden-crowned Kinglets are a rare but regular nester in riparian cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Goodding willow (Salix gooddingii var. variabilis) forests.  They are also found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains (Franzeb and Ohmart 1978).\r\n\r\nIn Colorado they inhabit mature, dense spruce-fir forests, Englemann spruce-Douglas-fir forests, and rarely Limber pine and Douglas fir forests (Wagner 1984, Ingold and Galati 1997).  Old-growth coniferous forests or stands with old growth characteristics can remain occupied year-round (Kingery 1988).  In New Mexico, they seem to be confined to the northern part of the state in summer and may descend to lower elevations in winter (Ligon 1961).  \r\n\r\nIn western Oregon/Cascade Mountains, this species is found in douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant communities (second growth and older second growth), and in northern Utah it is found in spruce-fir forests.\r\n\r\nGolden-crowned Kinglets can be found breeding in the southern Appalachian Mountains, chiefly in the spruce-fir forests, and to a lesser degree in hemlock and white pine forests (Hamel 1992, Simpson 1992).  \r\n\r\nThe elevation range for breeding Golden-crowned Kinglets in the eastern mountain regions is 300 to 1,600 m and between 240 and 3,450 m in the western U.S. (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nDuring migration, a broad range of habitats, including pine, fir, spruce forests, mixed coniferous-deciduous forests, deciduous forests, old fields, urban parks, urban and suburban yards, homesteads, rangelands, and fencerows provide habitat (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nWinter habitats are widely varied and include coniferous forests, pine groves, deciduous forests, bottomland hardwoods, swamps, riparian areas, and urban and suburban habitats (Ingold and Galati 1997).  They are found at all elevations in the northeastern and Appalachian Mountain portions of the winter range, and they inhabit coniferous forests (spruce, spruce-fir, red cedar [Juniperus virginiana], pine [pitch pine (Pinus rigida), loblolly pine (P. taeda), scrub pine (P. virginiana)]), mixed coniferous-deciduous forests (oak-pine, aspen-oak-pine), and deciduous forests (oak-maple [Quercus-Acer]). In southwestern Virginia, they are found in young and mature forests but are generally absent from areas that have been cleared within 3 years (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nIn southern and southeastern portions of range Golden-crowned Kinglets winter in pine forests (longleaf [Pinus palustris], scrub, and loblolly pines), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), pine groves, mixed woods, upland and bottomland hardwood forests, oak-gum-cypress (Quercus-Liquidambar-Taxodium) forests, cypress swamps, mesic hammocks, thick woods bordering streams, barrier islands, and sand hills (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nIn the Northwestern U.S., Golden-crowned Kinglets use coniferous forests (spruce-fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa]), mixed coniferous-deciduous forests (incense cedar [Calocedrus decurrens], white fir [Abies concolor], Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, California black oak [Quercus kelloggii]), willow, black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and alder (Alnus) thickets, deciduous woodlands, pi\u00f1on-juniper (Pinus cembroides-Juniperus) woodlands, foothill and lowland riparian forests, planted conifers in parks, cemeteries, and residential areas in lowlands (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, this species migrates to warmer and moister conifer forests or occasionally to hardwood forests (Lepthien and Bock 1976).  In Arizona, New Mexico, and southwestern Texas, it is found in breeding habitat (spruce-fir forests), pi\u00f1on-juniper woodlands, and riparian woodland (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nWintering birds can be found up to 3,300 m in elevation in the Rocky Mountain states, 3,450 m in southern Californian mountains, up to 1,500 m in Arizona, New Mexico, and southwestern Texas (Ingold and Galati 1997).\r\n\r\nN.
