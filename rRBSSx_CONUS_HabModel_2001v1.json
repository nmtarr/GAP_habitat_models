In general, habitats comprise of tropical wet, moist, and dry forests, as well as savannas, agricultural landscapes, and edges of areas that are wet or marshy ( Campbell 1998; Lee 2000). It occupies shrublands, chaparral, and orchards including suburban areas. \r\n\r\nThis snake populates the semiarid coastal plains of the northern part of its range; in areas where the native thorn-thicket habitat has been destroyed by agriculture (predominantly along seasonally filled watercourses, resacas, and arroyos) (Tennant 1998).It lives in localized suburban areas nearby buildings and in vacant lots (Ernst and Ernst 2003). This secretive snake burrows in or using soil, also hiding in fallen logs and leaf debris or trash during periods of inactivity.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rRBSSx", "ELCode": "ARADB08010", "scientific_name": "Coniophanes imperialis", "ITIS_TSN": "174218", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105679", "common_name": "Regal Black-striped Snake"}}
