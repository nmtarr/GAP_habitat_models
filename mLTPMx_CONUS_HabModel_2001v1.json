In Nevada, its predilection for stony ground is evident everywhere throughout the animal\u2019s range in the state.  \u201cIn western Nevada, especially, they are closely confined to slopes where stones from the size of walnuts up to those 8 inches or even more in diameter are scattered over and partly imbedded in the ground. ... Therefore, places below talus or below cliffs often are suitable for the mice\u201d(Hall 1946). Common in sagebrush, desert scrub, and desert succulent shrub habitats with rocky or stony groundcover, and sparse to dense canopy (CDFG 2003). Often they are taken beneath mesquite or mesquite and juniper, and sometimes they are found among blackbrush, ephedra, yucca, and Opuntia (Hoffmeister 1986, NMDGF 2002). In Nevada, the highest elevation reported in Hall (1946) is 6500 feet (1980 m); in Arizona elevation range is 1200-5500 feet (365-1675 m) (Hoffmeister 1986). Most of the range of the long-tailed pocket mouse lies within the Great Basin, and Mojave and Colorado deserts where it inhabits almost exclusively rocky, gravelly, and pebbly soil areas of lava beds, desert scrublands, boulder hillsides, sandy stream beds, and shallow arroyos. Plant communities inhabited include mesquite, creosote and burro bush, shadescale, and various sagebrushes, desert thorn, blackbrush, Acacia, Ephedra, and various yucca species (Wilson and Ruff 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLTPMx", "ELCode": "AMAFD05040", "scientific_name": "Chaetodipus formosus", "ITIS_TSN": "552482", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106345", "common_name": "Long-tailed Pocket Mouse"}}
