Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli), The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Retrieved from the Birds of North America Online: http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/326"}, "habitat_description": "The Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli; formerly Amphispiza belli) has been the subject of much debate about its taxonomic status.  As of May 2013, the species is comprised of five subspecies, but one, A. b. nevadensis, is likely to be elevated to species status. Four subspecies live in the U.S.\r\n\r\nIn general, Sage Sparrows are associated shrub-steppe communities in the northern portion of their range and chaparral and shrub lands of the southern part.  However, shrub type may be less important than vertical structure, patchiness, shrub spacing, and vegetation density (Martin and Carlson 1998); they breed in semi-open scrublands with evenly spaced shrubs 1 -2 m high (Chase and Carlson 2002).  They are reportedly less common in fragmented shrub lands (Chase and Carlson 2002).\r\n\r\nIn transmontane CA, they can be found in sagebrush, alkali desert scrub, and desert scrub; and in cismontane CA, they can be found in chamise and coastal scrub. (Zeiner et al. 1990).  They have not been found in canyons within the city of San Diego (Chase and Carlson 2002).\r\n\r\nThe Bell\u2019s Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli belli) lives in dry chaparral and coastal sage scrub of brittlebush, black sage, California buckwheat, California sagebrush, bush mallow, chamise, white sage, valley cholla, ceonothus, willow and bunchgrasses (Martin and Carlson 1998; Cicero 2010).  It prefers California sagebrush and brittlebush.  Chamise chaparral  is used in northern part of its range and in coastal San Diego County along with redshanks.  At higher elevations in the sourthern CA mountains, sagebrush is used (Chase and Carlson 2002).  They are less common in tall, dense, old chaparral (Chase and Carlson 2002).  Records exist of this species between 1219-1829 m in July in California.\r\n\r\nArtemisiospiza belli canescens occurs in drier desert scrub habitats of saltbush, shadscale, bitterbrush, big sagebrush, and rabbitbrush (Cicero 2010).  It is sometimes found in creosote bush-goldenhead desert scrub.  Individuals have been documented between 1219-1829 m in July in California and the type specimen was recorded in 1905 at 1676 m.  Some individuals are believed to move up in elevation following breeding (Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nThe San Clemente Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli clementeae) is only found on San Clemente Island, CA in maritime desert scrub (Martin and Carlson 2002, Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli nevadensis) is found in Great Basin sagebrush, either pure stands or those interspersed with bitterbrush, saltbrush, shadscale, rabbitbrush or greasewood (Martin and Carlson 1998).  They are rare in mixed sagebrush-juniper except where adjacent to shrub-steppe (Martin and Carlson 1998).  They have been documented up to 2400 m in elevation but usually breed below 1700 m (Martin and Carlson 1998, Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, Great Basin Sage Sparrows migrate south while the other subspecies either move short distances or remain on their breeding grounds.  Winter habitats include breeding habitats as well as desert washes, creosote bush, sparse cactus scrub, arid grasslands, arboreal yucca mixed with greasewood and honey mesquite and inkweed communities along the Colorado River (Martin and Carlson 1998).  N. Tarr, 20May2013.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWreGAP notes:\r\nPrefers semi-open habitats with evenly spaced shrubs 1-2 meters apart (Martin and Carlson 1998).  Vertical structure, habitat patchiness and vegetation density may be more important in habitat selection than specific shrub species (Martin and Carlson 1998).  Overgrown chaparral stands have generally fewer sage sparrows than shorter shrubs recovering from fire (Martin and Carlson 1998).   Prefers to breed in low desert scrub of saltbush, bitterbrush, big sagebrush and shadscale, but also uses creosotebush-goldenhead desertscrub (Martin and Carlson 1998). Breeds occasionally in mixed sagebrush juniper habitat adjacent to shrub-steppe habitat (Martin and Carlson 1998). Winters in big sagebrush in the northern part of its range; in desert washes, big sagebrush, creosotebush, sparse cactus scrub, arid grasslands, and arboreal yucca mixed with greasewood in more southern areas (Martin and Carlson 1998). In winter in the Sonoran desert in southern California, this species dwell in creosote bush-saltbush shrubland on valley floors (Repasky 1996).  In southern Idaho, the sage sparrow is almost entirely dependent on sagebrush for breeding habitat (Rich 1978).  Can be found in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) with cholla (Opuntia imbricata) in association with prairie dog towns (Clark et al. 1982).  In Arizona, this is a common summer resident on open sagebrush on the Navajo Indian Reservation (Phillips and Monson 1964).  Winters commonly on open ground with sparse brush in southwestern and western Arizona, and in Upper Sonoran grasslands of northern Arizona (Phillips and Monson 1964). In Colorado, these birds nest only in large stands at lower elevations of big sagebrush or mixed big sagebrush and greasewood (Kingery 1998).  In Nevada, this bird is found throughout the state in sagebrush areas; in Clark County it is a summer resident in woodlands, winter resident in desert scrub and riparian areas (Alcorn 1988).  In New Mexico, this species is confined to the northwest corner of the state in the summer, where big sagebrush occurs in large stands; in winter it is statewide (Ligon 1961).  In the lower Colorado River Valley of Arizona, this species occurs where there are dense patches of inkweed interspersed with bare ground in moderately dense honey mesquite woodlands or desert washes (Rosenberg et al. 1991). A. b. nevadensis will breed in creosote bush in wet years but not in dry years (Martin and Carlson 1998).  Occurs at 1,372-2,560 m (Kingery 1998, Bauman pers comm 2005).\r\n\r\nModel Comments\r\nA national species model was published prior to Dec 2012.  I created subspecies models and matched the species level models with them.  I made very few changes to the bSAGSx\u2019s map units but did change a few.  \r\n\r\nBelli and canescens subspecies need lower elevation limits in winter, but none given in the literature so I chose a very modest 1700 m (max for summer is 1829).  A. b. canescens was documented in June at 1,676 m.  Little known about winter canescens extent.  I included CA and AZ winter extent from the species but excluded cold desert and Arizona/New Mexico mountains.  I have little confidence in this subspecies winter range.\r\n\r\nFor A. b. nevadensis, I used the 2400 max elevation identified in one source that also said that breeding rarely occurs above 1700 m.  Without a winter elevation reference, I used 1700 because it is a little lower than 2400 and probably conservative.  \r\n\r\nNo elevation limit used for A. b. clementeae because San Clemented island is relatively flat.  \r\n\r\nModels only use primary map units and elevation.
