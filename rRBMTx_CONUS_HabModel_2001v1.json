The majority of the populations coincide with the Gulf Coastal Plain (Ernst and Barbour 1989).\r\n\r\nThis benthic species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and leaf litter. Hibernation takes place in holes found near overhanging banks or under rocks at the bottom of water bodies (Ernst and Barbour 1972). Its preferred habitats include big and medium sized rivers, low gradient streams, and deep and shallow pools or ponds. Riparian zones are restricted to forested wetlands only. Major characteristics of its habitat include slow moving currents of rivers and streams; swamps have abundant aquatic vegetation and basking sites, as well as soft, muddy bottoms (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nVegetation found in riparian forested wetland.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rRBMTx", "ELCode": "ARAAE02010", "scientific_name": "Sternotherus carinatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173759", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106452", "common_name": "Razor-backed Musk Turtle"}}
