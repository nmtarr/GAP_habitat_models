The species has also been documented in shrublands dominated by shadscale (Atriplex) (Hayward and Killpack, 1958; O\u2019Farrell and Clark, 1986), rabbitbrush (Hayward and Killpack, 1958; Small and Verts, 1983), blackbrush and jointfir (Ephedra) (Hayward and Killpack, 1958), greasewood (Fedlhammer, 1979; O\u2019Farrell and Clark, 1986). Montane shrublands with snowberry (symphoricarpos spp.) are not inhabited by P. parvus (Rickard, 1960)\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin pocket mouse has also been found in pinyon-juniper woodland and savanna (Deacon et al., 1964; Rickart et al., 2008; Vander Wall, 1997; Rodhouse et al., 2010). A single study has documented the species in ponderosa pine woodland, but only where shrubs were present (Sullivan and Sullivan, 2008); Rickard (1960) trapped none in any forest/woodland type, including ponderosa pine.\r\n\r\nThe species has been known to inhabit grasslands with minimal shrub components (Rickard, 1960; Kritzman, 1974; Gano and Rickard, 1982; Sullivan and Sullivan, 2008), but it avoids marsh and meadow environments (Feldhammer, 1979; O\u2019Farrell and Clark, 1986)\r\n\r\nSoil restricts the species\u2019 presence, as a loose, sandy structure is required for burrowing (Feldhammer, 1979; Rickard, 1980).\r\n\r\nIn Washington, the Great Basin pocket mouse has been documented down to elevations of 152 m, though lower elevations were not surveyed in that study; in fact, the species was most abundant at the lowest elevation site (Kritzman, 1974; see also O\u2019Farrell, 1975). In the southwest, the lowest reported elevation for the species is 1067 m (Hoffmeister, 1986). Maximum elevations have been reported at 2530 m in Nevada (Deacon et al., 1964; Rickart et al., 2008).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGBPMx", "ELCode": "AMAFD01070", "scientific_name": "Perognathus parvus", "ITIS_TSN": "180269", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102204", "common_name": "Great Basin Pocket Mouse"}}
