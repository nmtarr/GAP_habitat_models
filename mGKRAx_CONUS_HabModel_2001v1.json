Habitat destruction has been largely the result of agricultural conversion but also includes excess grazing, use of rodenticides (aimed mostly at similar species such as ground squirrels and other kangaroo rats), irrigation development, petroleum  and mineral development, and supporting infrastructure (USFWS 1998, Wilson and Ruff 1999, Williams and Kilburn 1991). Historically, this species preferred areas that receive < 15 cm of annual precipitation along the gently sloping valley plains of south-central California lacking abundant shrub cover (Grinnell 1932, Shaw 1934, Williams and Kilburn 1991). In the early part of the 20th century, both Grinnell (1932) and Shaw (1932) identified D. ingens habitat as consisting of shrubless areas on sandy loam soils, however, these environments no longer exist within the occupied range (Williams and Kilburn 1991). More recent inventories of extant colonies occur among a variety of soils ranging from fine sand to coarse pebble and clay which Williams and Kilburn (1991) describe as \"suboptimal to marginal.\" Additionally, their preference for shrubless plains appears to have given way to tolerance of shrub landscapes such as those containing San Joaquin saltbrush, goldenbush, and desert thorn interspersed with various introduced annual fescue grasses (Festuca spp.), red brome, Arabian grass, fiddleneck, malpais bluegrass, and peppergrass. USFWS (1998) indicates that remaining fragments of habitats include both grassland and shrub communities on slopes up to 22 percent and elevations of up to 868 meters (2850 ft). This species will use fallow grain fields (never those activately in cultivation) only when adjacent to existing colonies (Williams and Kilburn 1991). NatureServe ranks habitat preference as follows:\r\n\"Habitats listed in order of decreasing favorability: 1) annual grassland association in areas with less than 5-6 inches annual rain, and level to gently sloping ground, 2) alkali desert scrub association in areas with less than 5-6 inches annual rain, sandy loam soils, and level to gently sloping ground, 3) friable soils of sand, loam, clay loam or gravelly in areas with the above charcateristics, and 4) slopes of 10-15 degrees with the above characteristics and located near colonies in more favorable habitats (D. Williams, pers. comm.).\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGKRAx", "ELCode": "AMAFD03080", "scientific_name": "Dipodomys ingens", "ITIS_TSN": "180240", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103814", "common_name": "Giant Kangaroo Rat"}}
