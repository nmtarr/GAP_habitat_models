They are associated with varied forest types, including cove hardwoods, hemlock-birch, oak-pine, and various combinations of oaks, maples, hickories, beech, and yellow poplar. Grape, mountain laurel, rhododendron and ferns are also frequently mentioned. Woodrat populations are localized and have been referred to as being loosely organized colonies (Lee et al. 1982). They seek out ledges, fissures and small galleries among boulders, under suitably large talus slabs, and caves and rock faces to make large den and nest structures of sticks, leaves, trash and debris (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Occasionally, they will nest in buildings such as abandoned cabins and well houses, but generally they avoid humans. The breeding season is late winter to late summer, with the young born from March to September (Poole 1940, Merritt 1987). The gestation period is about 35 days (32 to 38 days) (Birney 1973). Two or three litters of usually two to four young are produced annually (Poole 1940, Schwartz and Schwartz 1959). Sexual maturity is reached in less than a year, and some early-born females (but not males) breed in the season of their birth (Wiley 1980). Woodrats are thought to live longer than most small rodents and one female is known to have lived more than three years in the wild (Fitch and Rainey 1956). However, mortality is normally high.", "taxanomic": {"gap_code": "mALWOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF08100", "scientific_name": "Neotoma magister", "ITIS_TSN": "555661", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101808", "common_name": "Allegheny Woodrat"}, "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strEdgeType": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5"}}
