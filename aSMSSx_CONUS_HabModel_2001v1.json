The northern limit of their distribution is approximately the Monterey Peninsula and the southernmost is the San Luis Obispo County line. Localities are found along the Carmel Valley and the eastern slopes of the Santa Lucia Mountains. \r\nAdults have been reported to occupy moist redwood and mixed coniferous forests. While inland, they are found on wooded north-facing slopes with tan bark and maples. In the Big Sur localities, they occur in wet soils along creeks. However, salamanders have also been found under cover in disturbed, open habitats including a park in the city of Monterey (Jockusch et al. 2001). Inland, this species is found on wooded, north-facing slopes vegetated with maples and bark oaks (Green et al. 2013).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSMSSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD02160", "scientific_name": "Batrachoseps luciae", "ITIS_TSN": "668245", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103559", "common_name": "Santa Lucia Mountains Slender Salamander"}}
