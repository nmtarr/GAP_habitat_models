They used a minimum patch size of 500ha and smaller patches within 2km.  Kerkhoff et al. (2000) assessed panther habitat in relation to forest cover.  They used a lower limit of 3% canopy cover within 900km^2 to define forested habitat.  Per Kacy's direction to the recent publication by Beier et al. (2003), I eliminated the minimum patch size of 500ha from the model: \"Although available data clearly indicate the importance of forests and forest cover to panthers, we find no basis for the ideas that panthers are reluctant to move greater than 90 m from forest cover, that panthers avoid forest patches smaller than 500 ha, or that BCNP and ENP do not provide useful habitat for panthers.\" (from recommendations in Beier et al. 2003).  I don't think they will venture too far out into pasture/ag or open prairie in south FL, so I decided to include a buffer of 250m on the primary MUs (i.e. 0 ha meaning all cells) into auxiliary MUs to try and eliminate large patches of ag/pasture/open veg.  This distance is purely subjective but almost 3 times the recommended distance of Maehr of which Beier has such a problem and also includes cover types other than forest.", "intElevMin": null, "ysnHydroOW": false, "Region": "Southeast", "CommonName": "Cougar", "ysnUrbanInclude": false, "strUseForInt": null, "intEdgeEcoWidth": null, "intFromBuffWV": null, "strStreamVel": null, "Modeler": "Matt Rubino", "strEdgeType": null, "strSalinity": null, "ysnHydroFW": false, "Reviewer": "Jeff Lonneker", "ysnUrbanExclude": true, "strAvoid": "Med", "intFromBuffOW": null}}, "references": ["Katnik, D.

Florida Field Naturalist. 20 (4):97-103."], "habitat_description": "Puma concolor utilizes a broad range of habitats.\r\n\r\nWestern cougars inhabit riparian vegetation (Logan and Irwin, 1985; Koehler and Hornocker, 1991; Dickson and Beier, 2002; Nicholson, 2009), chaparral (Dickson and Beier, 2002; Nicholson, 2009), montane and subalpine mixed conifer forest (Logan and Irwin, 1985; Laing, 1988; Koehler and Hornocker, 1991; McRae, 2004; Katnik, 2002; Rieth, 2010), spruce-fir forest (Laing, 1988; McRae, 2004), pinyon-juniper woodlands (Laing, 1988; McRae, 2004; Stoner et al., 2008; Nicholson, 2009), coastal forest (McRae, 2004), Douglas-fir forest (Seidensticker et al., 1973; Logan and Irwin, 1985; Koehler and Hornocker, 1991; McRae, 2004), curlleaf mountain mahogany shrubland (Logan and Irwin, 1985), ponderosa pine woodland and forest (Seidensticker et al., 1973; Laing, 1988; McRae, 2004), ponderosa pine-oak woodlands (Laing, 1988), mountain sagebrush (Logan and Irwin, 1985; McRae, 2004), and deciduous and conifer woodlands (McRae, 2004; Stoner et al., 2008; Nicholson, 2009; Rieth, 2010). \r\n\r\nGiven identical vegetative composition between sites, the species prefers sites with a denser understory and on steeper slopes (Laing, 1988). Dense shrub or sapling cover, rugged rock outcrops, boulder piles, and overhanging cliffs provide the cover necessary for mountain lions to stalk prey (Hornocker, 1970; Seidensticker et al., 1973; Beier et al., 1995). Logan and Irwin (1985) document occasional, successful kills in open habitat, but never farther than 250 from dense, tall vegetation or canyons.\r\n\r\nAside from slight incursions into open habitats while hunting (Logan and Irwin, 1985) and occasional rapid dispersal treks (Stoner et al., 2008), these western individuals avoid open grassland/meadows (Seidensticker et al., 1973; Laing, 1988; Dickson and Beier, 2002; Nicholson, 2009), low-growing scrub/shrub (Laing, 1988; Harveson, 1997; Stoner et al., 2008; Nicholson, 2009), barren land (Harveson, 1997; McRae, 2004), slickrock sandstone canyons (Laing, 1988), sagebrush bottomlands (Laing, 1988), cropland (Laing, 1988; McRae, 2004; Nicholson, 2009), pasture (Laing, 1988), urban or developed areas (Dickson and Beier, 2002; Nicholson, 2009), and gentle slopes (Logan and Irwin, 1985).\r\n\r\nIn south Florida, P. concolor coryi inhabits hammock forests (Maehr and Cox, 1995; Belden et al., 1988; Dees et al., 2001), mixed swamp forests (Belden et al., 1988; Cox et al., 2006; Benson, 2008), upland hardwoods (Benson, 2008), pine scrub (Benson, 2008), conifer and hardwood forests (Dees et al., 2001; Cox et al., 2006; Land et al., 2008), cypress swamps (Maehr and Cox, 1995; Dees et al., 2001); forested wetlands (Land et al., 2008).\r\n\r\nMaehr and Cox (1995) found that 96% of P. concolor observations were within 90 m of \u201cpreferred\u201d cover types, which they defined as hardwood hammocks, hardwood swamps, and cypress swamps. Comsikey et al. (2002) and Shrader-Frechette (2004) argue that mosaics including open marsh and prairie in proximity to forest and shrublands are ideal habitat (see also: Belden et al., 1988).\r\n\r\nThe Florida subspecies (coryi) generally avoids prairies (Maehr and Cox, 1995; Belden et al., 1988), marshes (Belden et al., 1988; Dees et al., 2001; Cox et al., 2006; Benson et al., 2008), agricultural land (Maehr and Cox, 1995; Dees et al., 2001; Cox et al., 2006; Land et al., 2008), and developed areas (Dees et al., 2001; Cox et al., 2006).\r\n\r\nNorth American P. concolor have been reported at elevations from sea level up to 4,000 m (Currier, 1983).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCOUGx", "ELCode": "AMAJH04010", "scientific_name": "Puma concolor", "ITIS_TSN": "552479", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101637", "common_name": "Cougar"}}
