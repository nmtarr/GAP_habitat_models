In Colorado, it is most frequently found in montane shrublands and semidesert shrublands and on the edges of pinyon-juniper woodlands and montane and subalpine forests (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It also inhabits open parklands with sufficient shrub, rock, or tree cover (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The cottontail tends to avoid dense, riparian vegetation and heavy coniferous forest (Fitzgerald et al. 1994), and culitivated lands (Sullivan et al. 1989). It inhabits the territory from upper part of Upper Sonoran Life Zone upward through the Transition Zone and sometimes above the Transition Zone in Nevada (Hall 1995). S. nuttallii inhabits the grassy and rocky areas near or among spruce and fir or on the sagebrush flats and gullies near ponderosa pine or spruce fir (Hoffmeister 1986). It may use downed trees for shelter (Hoffmeister 1986). The species inhabits borders between forest and plain, brushlands, rock outcroppings, thick sagebrush, and shrubby areas near agricultural land throughout the region (Wassink 1993). It may possibly occur in subalpine coniferous forest in the Tularosa Mountains and Corner mountains (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). The elevation is between 1,189 and 3,506 meters (Hall 1995, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). S. nuttallii occurs on the Kaibab Plateau, Chuska, Tunitcha, and White mountains, Skeleton Mesa, northern Navajo County, and perhaps near Page in Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). It is present in the western three-fifths of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found in Most of Nevada (Hall 1995). The species occurs in the Chuska, Jemez, San Juan, Sangre de Cristo, and Zuni mountains, the upper San Juan River Valley, and likely on the Mogollon Plateau (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It is present in most of Utah (Durrant 1952, UDWR 2003). Can be found in the following mountain ranges:  Pine Forest Mountains; Virginia Mountains; White Mountains; Jemez Mountains; San Juan Mountains; Sangre de Cristo Mountains; Chuska Mountains; Zuni Mountains; Bearwallow Mountains; Chuska-Tunicha Mountains; Rocky Mountains.\r\nIn California, this species  is found on the east slopes of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades from Siskiyou and Modoc counties south through the Great Basin to southern Inyo Co. (Orr 1940), and probably to San Bernardino county. Primarily an animal of rocky, sage-covered hills and canyons, it is common in sagebrush, fairly common in sparse, montane riparian habitats, and uncommon in subalpine conifer, pinyon-juniper, juniper, and alpine dwarf-shrub habitats. Altitudinal range in California is from 1372 to 3200 m (4500 to 10,500 ft) (Orr 1940, Ingles 1965, Chapman 1975). They prefer to feed on grasses but also consumes sagebrush and juniper berries (quoted from [Hoefler et al. 2008] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMOCOx", "ELCode": "AMAEB01060", "scientific_name": "Sylvilagus nuttallii", "ITIS_TSN": "180126", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103067", "common_name": "Mountain Cottontail"}}
