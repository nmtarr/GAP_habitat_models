They were historically associated with open canyons, foothills, escarpments, river valleys, grasslands, broken forests, steep canyons and riparian edges where suitable nest sites existed but have recently colonized open areas with man-made structures that are suitable nesting substrates (Brown and Brown 1995).  They avoid dense forests, deserts, and alpine areas (Brown and Brown 1995).\r\n\r\nThe breeding range has expanded in the Carolinas over the past 5 decades.  Range expansion into the Piedmont ecoregion was first documented, and now several colony sites in S.C. along the Great Pee Dee River have been documented (McNair 2013).  This range expansion appears to be occuring in a linear fashion along the river corridor.\r\n\r\nCliff Swallows are colonial nesters and their colonies can be composed of thousands of nests.  Colonies were traditionally placed at the juncture of vertical and horizontal surfaces of cliffs, rock ledges, banks and cave entrances, but now include wooden barns, concrete bridges, under eaves of buildings, highway culverts, and under overhangs on dams (DeGraaf et al. 1991, Andrews and Righter 1992, Brown and Brown 1995).  They can also be found on the sides of steep canyons in the foothills and lower elevations of the Sierra Nevada, Rocky, and Cascade mountains (Brown and Brown 1995).  Proximity to a source of mud for use in nest construction is often cited as a breeding habitat requirement, but colonies can be located several kilometers away from the nearest mud supply (Brown and Brown 1995).  McNair (2013) documented several colonies within the Great Pee Dee River corridor, but some were at upland sites on man-made structures (mean distance to river = 5.8 km, SD = 4.8, range = 0.3 - 15km).\r\n\r\nCliff Swallows feed over a variety of open areas, appearing to prefer grassy pastures, plowed fields, and other open areas, but they also feed above floodplain forests, canyons, and water (lakes, ponds, rivers; Brown and Brown 1995). \r\n\r\nIn the southwestern U.S., nesting colonies are found almost throughout Arizona in vicinity of water (Phillips et al. 1964).  Altitudinal range extends from Lower Sonoran through transition zones, from sea level to about 2,770 m (Brown and Brown 1995).  The species' highest known breeding site is on glaciated headwater cliffs of South Mineral Creek at 3,655 m (Kingery 1998), but they are rarely found above 3,000 m (Brown and Brown 1995).  They are common residents across Utah, normally in the lowlands, but occasionally in the mountains up to 2,591 m (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003).  They are summer residents and transients in Nevada (Alcorn 1988).   \r\n\r\nDuring migration, Cliff Swallows occur widely over and around lakes, marshes, and agricultural areas as they move to their South American wintering grounds (Andrews and Righter 1992).
