Winter hibernacula are in caves, box culverts, dams, rock crevices, and mines (Fujita and Kunz 1984, Marks and Marks 2006).  Summer hibernacula include the types of sites used during winter but also trees, and males and females sometimes roost in different locations.  In the Southeast, it is primarily a forest dwelling bat; maternity colonies are located in hollow trees, but also in secluded places within buildings and in caves (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Bridges, attics of houses and abandoned buildings have also been used for roosts (Brown 1997) but summer habits are poorly understood (Wilson & Ruff 1999).  Individuals will even find temporary shelter in clumps of leaves or in Spanish moss in the southeast coastal plain (Webster et al. 1985).  Males probably roost largely in solitude in hollow trees, buildings, rock crevices and caves (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  They were found to prefer roosts close to streams in North Carolina (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Males and females were found to roost farther away from roads than random sites in Arkansas (Ammerman et al. 2012).  In Florida, summer roosts include spanish moss, \"drainpipes through bridges\", also probably foliage and crevices (Marks and Marks 2006).  In Texas, summer roost sites include caves, bridges, buildings, live or dead tree foliage (deciduous or evergreen), Spanish moss, and box culverts (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Dead foliage in oaks is a preferred roost site.  In Wyoming and Colorado, they roost primarily in trees during summer; roosts in caves, mines, and rock crevices are uncommon (Adams 2003).  \r\n\r\nThis species has typically been associated with open water and forest edges and purportedly avoids deep woods and open fields (Fujita and Kunz 1984, NatureServe 2005).  Associations with mature hardwood forests with mature overstory, complex vertical structure, and abundant midstory trees have been found in Arkansas, South Carolina, and North Carolina (Ammerman et al. 2012), but it is unclear whether the interiors of these forests were used. They have been observed in scrubby flatwoods, over pond, in mesic hammock, and longleaf pine flatwoods (Moore 1949). N.
