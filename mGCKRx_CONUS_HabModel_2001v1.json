They are often found on disturbed or over-grazed areas (e.g. mesquite savannas) characterized by sparse, open vegetation and deep, loose sand where they forage on grasses, annual forbs, and shrubs (Schmidly 2004, Baumgardner 1991, Bailey 1905). Blair (1952) reported this species in an area cleared of native brush that was revegetated in various herbaceous weeds such as Aristida, Bouteloua, and Andropogon. Bailey (1905) found D. compactus was abundant in the yellow-sand prairie of southeastern Texas. Raun (1959) recorded a specimen among deep, sandy soils within the post oak-blackjack oak association habitat of Gonzales County.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGCKRx", "ELCode": "AMAFD03160", "scientific_name": "Dipodomys compactus", "ITIS_TSN": "180235", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105160", "common_name": "Gulf Coast Kangaroo Rat"}}
