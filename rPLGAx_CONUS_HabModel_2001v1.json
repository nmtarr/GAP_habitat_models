Also, northern Texas, western Oklahoma, central Ohio, and northern Missouri (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Hammerson 1999; Rossman et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003; Walley et al. 2003). The elevational range was estimated from 120 to 2290 meters, but populations are more common below 1830 meters (Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and ground litter. Hibernation sites can be rodent or crayfish burrows, ant mounds, old wells, under slabs of concrete, crevices, or even underwater (Natureserve.org). The preferred habitats of this species include creeks, low gradient rivers, shallow water pools, and springs. Riparian habitats include bog, fen, herbaceous wetland, scrub-shrub wetland, and temporary pools. Throughout its range, populations are established in areas characterized as cropland, hedgerow, grassland, and suburban orchards; ponds, sloughs, marshes, lakes, prairie, farmland, pinyon-juniper zone, and vacant lots. Also present in some residential areas, dumps, and other moist areas (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Hammerson 1999; Natureserve.org; Rossman et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nGP\t-Herbaceous wetland, scrub-shrub wetland, temporary pools, ponds, sloughs, slow creeks or rivers, but also terrestrial habitats; cropland.
