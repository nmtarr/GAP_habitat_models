Ecology and Conservation of Neotropical Migrant L"], "habitat_description": "The American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) breeds across much of the northern and eastern US and southern Canada (Sherry and Holmes 1997). It winters in Baja, CA, central Florida, central Mexico south to Ecuador and Brazil (Sherry and Holmes 1997, Kingery 1998). In the southwest, the American Redstart breeds in northeastern Utah, south Apache County in east-central Arizona, and north-central Colorado (Phillips et al. 1964, Hayward et al. 1976, Sherry and Holmes 1997, Kingery 1998). It is an uncommon to common migrant throughout the southwest (Ligon 1961, Phillips et al. 1964, Hayward et al. 1976, Ryser 1985, Alcorn 1988, Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998). \r\n\r\nGenerally regarded as a forest interior species, the redstart prefers moist, deciduous, second-growth woodlands with abundant shrubs during the breeding season (Sherry and Holmes 1997).  They are also found in shrubby second-growth woodlands, tree fall gaps in old-growth forest, orchards, and mixed-deciduous-coniferous woodlands.  Breeding also occurs in coniferous woodlands in the northern part of its range (Alberta and New Brunswick), but deciduous vegetation is preferred over coniferous vegetation in the northeastern United States (Sherry and Holmes 1997).   Redstarts are more commonly found near water in the southern and western parts of their range (Sherry and Holmes 1997).\r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, important forest communities include elm-ash-cottonwood, southern mixed mesic hardwoods, oak-gum-cypress, oak-hickory and cove hardwoods, and yellow birch.  In the Atlantic Piedmont and Coastal Plains, they favor bottomland hardwoods and swamps while in the Appalachians, they use more open riparian hardwood forests/woodlands and are less frequently encountered in medium-growth upland hardwoods (Hamel 1992).   \r\n\r\nBreeding habitats for the American Redstart in western North America include willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.) thickets, riparian woodlands, and coniferous woodlands (Sherry and Holmes 1997). They prefer closed canopies, a dense mid and understory, and well-developed undergrowth (AGFD 2002). Redstarts are often associated with streamside habitats (Kingery 1998). Breeding sites in Colorado occur in lowland riparian areas dominated by woodlands of cottonwoods (Populus spp.) with understories of willows and alders (Kingery 1998, BISON-M).  \r\n\r\nIn Colorado, this species is common below 1,981m, but can occur up to 3,657m (Andrew and Righter 1992, Biota Information System of New Mexico, Schrupp and Cade 1989). In New Mexico, the American Redstart inhabits woodlands at elevations between 853-2,286m (BISON-M). In Arizona, this bird occupies habitats from 1,582- 2,245m in elevation (AGFD 2002).\r\n\r\nAmerican Redstarts appear to be sensitive to patch size in parts of eastern North America with a preference for patches >4,000 ha (Sherry and Holmes 1997).\r\n\r\nHabitats utilized during migration include wider varieties of shrubby and wooded habitats, various forests, woodlands, scrublands, thickets, and agricultural fields (Sherry and Holmes 1997, AGFD 2002), but often consist of the much of the same habitat used during the breeding season.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of American Redstarts winter in the Carribean and Central and South America but some individuals winter in southern Florida and California.  A larger variety of habitats are used during winter than during the breeding season but they show an affinity for native forests and woodlands at low or middle elevations (up to 3,000 m in South America, up to 1,500 m in Jamaica).  They also inhabit mesic to dry forests, secondary growth and scrub thickets, and can be abundant in shade coffee plantations, mangroves, lowland secondary growth, and dry scrub (Sherry and Holmes 1997).
