Understory and and mid-story riparian vegetation are often important habitat factors. Breeds in stream corridors or moist ravines in coniferous forest, shaded woodlands, dense second-growth, aspen in foothills and mountain slopes. Breeds along stream corridors or moist ravines in woodlands, dense second growth coniferous forests in foothills and mountain slopes, and also may be found in similar types in suburban settings. This species has habitat associations with forest dominated by douglas fir, lodgepole pine. This species depends heavily on riparian corridors and is relatively restricted to riparian bottomlands and adjacent conifer forests in the Northern Rockies. Habitat is linked to areas with greater numbers of snags, and frequently detected in cottonwood stands, but also wetland, riparian shrub, douglas-fir, cedar/grand fir, and spruce/fir habitats.  Habitat associations on the Colorado front range include Douglas fir, but also aspen/willow, ponderosa pine and mixed forest stands. The Cordilleran flycatcher favors Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak stands with high pine density and moderate understory oak density in northern Arizona. In Mexico, this species commonly breeds in semiarid to humid evergreen and pine-oak fores and cloud forest often in shady arroyos, usually seen in shady understory, rarely in open areas except when migrating). Nests in cavities and also constructs nests in fork of sapling or shrub (Nature Serve).\r\nCompared to Pacific-slope Flycatcher, Cordilleran breeds in habitats cooler, more arid, and denser boreal forests of pine, fir, and spruce (Picea sp.; Small 1994). Still, \u201ccoolness, shade, and nest sites\u201d are requisites, and this species, from Alberta to n. Mexico, \u201cinvariably associated with water courses, and thus openings, in the timber\u201d (Johnson 1980)(quoted directly from Lowther 2000).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nFound in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock, 1998). In Colorado, occur from 1830-2040 m and inhabit primarily montane and subalpine forests and can occur up to 3048 m (Kingery, 1998) and 1000-3500 m (Lowther 2000). They frequent streams and moist ravines with vertical cliffs, outcrops, or steep banks and will also nest around cabins and mines where they can find dirt cutbanks and rocky ledges (AOU, 1983). In Arizona is a common summer resident in the boreal zones throughout the southeastern part of the state (Phillips et al., 1964). In Nevada is an uncommon summer resident at middle altitudes on the mountain ranges and is transient elsewhere (Alcorn, 1988). Will breed along streams with nest placed in cliffs, rock walls, earth banks or buildings (Lowther, 2000). In California, the Cordilleran flycatcher breeds in eastside pine, white fir, and lodgepole pine habitats in the Warner Mts. And vicinity and may breed in the White Mts. And the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada near Mono and Mammoth Lakes (Gaines 1988, Small 1994).\r\nFor se. Washington to s.-central Nevada, Cordilleran Flycatcher relatively rare and found in forests growing on or near stream-eroded pumice and various forms of eroded lava; favored breeding sites occur along streams with strong gradients where coniferous trees overhang and have steep banks. Typical trees in suitable habitat include Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), white fir (Abies concolor), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa); Douglas fir included only in certain localities (Johnson 1980). In Nevada, found in areas with quaking aspen mixed with subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), Douglas fir, and white fir; in s. Nevada (Lincoln, Clark Cos.), found in dense stands of Douglas fir, white fir, or western bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) on steep slopes near rock outcrops (quoted directly from Lowther 2000).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn S. Dakota, found in mixed forests of aspen, birch (Betula sp.), and ponderosa pine with thick undergrowth of maple, chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), and unidentified \u201csoft chaparral\u201d species (Johnson 1980). On Mogollon Rim, Coconino Co., AZ, nests in snowmelt drainages at about 2,600 m elevation with canopy of quaking aspen, Douglas fir, white fir, ponderosa pine, white pine (Pinus strobiformis), Gambel\u2019s oak (Quercus gambelii), and understory of canyon maple (Acer grandidentatum), New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana), and saplings of overstory tree species (Martin and Li 1992, Martin 1998)(quoted directly from Lowther 2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCOFLx", "ELCode": "ABPAE33160", "scientific_name": "Empidonax occidentalis", "ITIS_TSN": "554255", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100103", "common_name": "Cordilleran Flycatcher"}}
