They are frequently captured in shallow, rocky rapids.  Hellbenders are most abundant in water that is clear and has many large, flat rocks for shelter, nesting, and breeding.  Other large submerged objects, such as logs, and bank holes in or at water's edge may also be used for shelter.  Stream siltation and chemical or thermal pollution pose possible threats for this species.  Typically, only streams in predominantly forested watersheds provide the cool, well-oxygenated stream conditions required by hellbenders. Hellbender presence in streams is positively correlated with forested buffer width (Graham et al. 2011).  Usually avoids water warmer than 20 C.  Males prepare nests beneath large flat rocks or submerged logs.  Under rocks in medium to large streams with cool, well oxygenated water.  They have become harder to find in northern mountains recently, but are still common in several larger, clean streams.  Hellbenders lay eggs in late summer or fall.  Winter breeding has been observed in Spring River, Arkansas (Peterson et al. 1989).  Clutch size averages about 350-500; increases with female body length.  Several females may oviposit in same site.  Males guard developing eggs. Larvae hatch in 1.5-3 months and lose gills about 18 months after hatching.  Sexually mature in 5-8 years (Minton 1972, Peterson et al. 1988).  Lifespan of 25+ years.  S.
