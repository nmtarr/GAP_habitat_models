In much of their range, scrub-jays occupy three principal habitats: pinyon, oak, and mixed pinyon-oak woodlands (Peterson, 1993; Bardwell et al. 2001; Curry et al., 2003).\r\n\r\nThe species frequents scrub and dry woodlands dominated by oaks or pinon pines, but has also adapted well to suburban landscapes (Curry et al. 2002; Crosbie et al., 2011).  Scrub (especially oak, pinon and juniper), brush, chaparral, coastal scrub, oak-pine association; also gardens, orchards, and riparian woodland (Moriarty et al., 1985; Zeiner et al., 1990; Lawrence, 1996; Curry et al. 2002). In some sites in Nevada occurs in pure mountain mahogany shrubland and chaparral habitats without oaks (Curry et al. 2002). Near Colorado Springs, Colorado, western scrub-jays inhabit areas of scrub oak (Quercus gambelii), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginianus), one-seeded juniper (J. mexicana) and a few ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) (Vierling and Winternitz 2003). Found as a resident in Colfax County, New Mexico in grazed and ungrazed rangeland consisting of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) (Goguen and Mathews 1998).   Found in pinyon-juniper habitat in northeastern New Mexico (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) (DeMarco et al. 2000). Occurs in pinyon-juniper habitat in the Sandia Mountains in New Mexico (Tatschl 1967).\r\n\r\nOccurs in desert riparian woodlands and cactus forests in southern Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico (Curry et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bWESJx", "ELCode": "ABPAV06040", "scientific_name": "Aphelocoma californica", "ITIS_TSN": "554128", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105554", "common_name": "Western Scrub-jay"}}
