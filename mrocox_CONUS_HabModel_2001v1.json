Populations in the Guadalupe and Chisos mountains may be extirpated since no specimens have been seen or collected in the last 30 years (Schmidly 2004). However, according to the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (2004), S. robustus was collected in the Guadalupe Mountains in Eddy County, New Mexico. Additionally, GBIF records, from Angelo State Natural History Collections (ASNHC 2015), indicate this species as being present in Big Bend National Park as recently as 2008.\r\nS. robustus was formerly considered a subspecies of S. floridanus (Ruedas 1998). It will likely be in higher elevations of the Guadalupe mountains (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004). S. floridanus, a similar species, occurs in oak, pinyon-juniper, and chaparral woodlands, and in coniferous forest (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004). In Texas, S. floridanus occurs in brushland and marginal areas (Davis and Schmidly 1997). In the Chisos Mts. of Texas during the 1940s, William Davis found that this species preferred dense brushy habitats near ravine bottoms, particularly sumac thickets, mountain mahogany, white brush, and scrub oak interspered among open sites. They also utilized rocky areas where boulder spaces and crevices provided cover and refugia (Schmidly 2004).\r\nThe contiguous area in the Davis Mountains that contains suitable vegetation preferred by S. robustus is 1,815 square kilometers; considering only areas above 1,675 meters, potential habitat within the range is approximately 730 square kilometers (Ruedas 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mROCOx", "ELCode": "AMAEB01041", "scientific_name": "Sylvilagus robustus", "ITIS_TSN": "555658", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100820", "common_name": "Robust Cottontail"}}
