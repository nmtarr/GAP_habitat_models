Brigham Young University Press, Provo, UT."}, "habitat_description": "All Regions:\r\nPrimarily montane coniferous and mixed forests in Transition Zone at elevational range of 1,150\u20132,500 m, but also found in Upper Sonoran Zone, and locally in deciduous riparian woodland in arid intermontane basins above 920 m (Barlow 1977). Prefers warm, dry forest to cool, moist forest (Johnsgard 1979). Typical habitat within U.S. is dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), but also associated widely, south of Wyoming, with pi\u00f1on-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus) woodlands. Generally more common in ponderosa pine than in pi\u00f1on-juniper (Laudenslayer and Balda 1976, Hejl et al. 1995).\r\nWithin ponderosa pine habitats, common in both pure stands as well as stands with a considerable component of shrub to tree-sized Gambel oak (Quercus gambelli) (Rosenstock 1998, Battin and Lawler 2006). Within pi\u00f1on-juniper, prefers denser, higher elevation woodlands that are dominated by pi\u00f1on over drier, more open juniper-dominated stands (Andrews and Righter 1992, Pavlacky and Anderson 2004, Wise-Gervais 2005). Found in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and in mixed conifer-aspen (Populus tremuloides), but not in pure aspen stands (Hejl et al. 1995, Goguen and Mathews 2000). In intermontane riparian woodlands, inhabits cottonwoods (Populus), box elders (Acer negundo), and willows (Salix); uses this habitat commonly in Great Basin (Bent 1950, Hayward et al. 1976), but also in Arizona (Barlow 1977) and in Rio Grande valley, New Mexico (Monson 1946). In Colorado, occurs also in Gambel oak shrubland with or without scattered tall conifers (Andrews and Righter 1992, Odell and Knight 2001). In Chiricahua Mtns. of se. Arizona, more common in ponderosa pine than in adjacent oak-juniper-pine (Quercus-Juniperus-Pinus), and absent from oak forest at lower elevations (Balda 1969, 1970). In mountains of se. Arizona, inhabits riparian forests along perennial or intermittent streambeds dominated by a mixture of riparian and upland tree species (Christoferson and Morrison 2001, Wise-Gervais 2005).\r\nGenerally favors coniferous woodlands of open structure with some deciduous understory (Balda 1969, Johnsgard 1979), and in steep terrain favors canyon bottoms. Typical habitat in the recently colonized areas of s. California is ecotone of dry canyonside and riparian canyon bottom (Norris 1986).\r\nInhabits more arid woodland on eastern slope of Sierra Nevada of California than Cassin\u2019s Vireo, which inhabits western slope (Norris 1986). Often separated ecologically from Gray Vireo by altitude and habitat; Gray Vireo inhabits juniper scrub at lower elevations than Plumbeous Vireo, although co-occupancy of pi\u00f1on-juniper habitat by these 2 species is known (Barlow et al. 1970, Francis et al. 2011)(quoted directly from Goguen and Curson 2012).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nPrefers warm, dry forest (Curson and Goguen 1998). Typical U.S. habitat is ponderosa pine also pinyon-juniper; more common in ponderosa than pinyon-juniper; within pinyon-juniper, prefers denser woodlands at higher elevations (Curson and Goguen 1998). Riparian habitat commonly used in the Great Basin; also in Arizona and in the Rio Grande valley in New Mexico; in Colorado, occurs in Gambel oak with scattered conifer; in Chiricahua mountains in Arizona occurs in oak-juniper-pine, but is most common in ponderosa pine (Curson and Goguen 1998). Found in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998). Found in Colorado near Denver at breeding time in Ponderosa pine forest; also with Douglas fir, chokecherry, wax currant, skunkbrush, kinnikinnick, and various grasses (Chace and Cruz 1999).  May be an indicator species of degraded habitat in riparian forested areas of the Toiyabe Mountain Range in central Nevada, in particular degraded willow and aspen (Warkentin and Reed 1999). Found in pinyon-juniper habitat in northeastern New Mexico (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) (DeMarco et al. 2000). In southeastern Arizona this species can be found in mid-canopy nesting sites, with major vegetation of alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana), douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp), and pines (Pinus spp.), with deciduous trees of Arizona sycamore (Plantanus wrightii), Arizona madrone (Arbutus arizonica), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), and Arizona walnut (Juglans major) (Christoferson and Morrison 2001). In Arizona, winters in willow-cottonwood associations in central-southern and southern Arizona; also in towns, dense mesquites, and occasionally in live oaks (Christoferson and Morrison 2001). Will breed in the pygmy pinyon-juniper forests of Colorado, also in deciduous trees along foothill streams and aspen, with both of these habitats occurring near coniferous forests (Kingery 1988).  In New Mexico will nest in walnut trees; also in box elder, maple, ash or pine (Ligon 1961).\r\nDuring winter, in s. Arizona, uses lowland riparian woodland, mostly cottonwoods and willows, as well as dense mesquite (Prosopis) and trees in towns (Monson and Phillips 1981)(quoted directly from Goguen and Curson 2012).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bPLVIx", "ELCode": "ABPBW01280", "scientific_name": "Vireo plumbeus", "ITIS_TSN": "554477", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100629", "common_name": "Plumbeous Vireo"}}
