(1985) hypothesized the reason for BSKI\u2019s range expansion into the southwestern U.S. may be related to (1) the increase in suitable foraging habitat created by irrigated agricultural lands, (2) retired cropland and (3) grassland succession created by brush and tree removal operations.  SWGAP included the following narrative of the White-tailed Kite\u2019s range in their habitat notes:\r\n\u201cAs of 1984, there have been over 60 sightings (n \u02dc 105) from 42 different localities in eight Arizona counties (Cochise, Graham, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz, Yavapai and Yuma; Gatz et al. 1985).  This species is considered a rare resident (Edison et al. 1995).  Upon publication of Monson and Phillips (1981), there were three substantiated reports, where this species was photographed, in Arizona (Monson and Phillips 1981).  It has been photographed within Altar Valley northeast of Baboquivari Peak, north of the Santa Rita Mountains and one near Hereford, Cochise County (Monson and Phillips 1981). Other reports include the west side of the Dragoon Mountains, Blue Point east of Phoenix, Kansas Settlement (Cochise County), near Sierra Vista, within the Cibola NWR, southeast of San Simon (Cochise County) and near Poston (Yuma County; Monson and Phillips 1981).  A breeding pair was confirmed in oak savanna approximately 150 meters from a residence near Sonoita, Santa Cruz County (Gatz et al. 1985).  Additional sightings reported were of single birds along the Colorado River, Yuma County (n = 3; Gatz et al. 1985), where Rosenberg et al. (1991) considered it a \u201crare visitor\u201d to the Lower Colorado River valley.  Also, it has been observed in the Colorado River Delta, Mexico (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  Edison et al. (1995) suggest this species may be observed in Avra Valley (Pinal Air Park), Buenos Aires NWR and Hereford.  It is also believed to occur along and south of the Gila River (Johnson 1987).  Also, two pair were observed in the Santa Cruz wash channel on abandoned farmland 11 km south of Casa Grande, Pinal County (Gatz et al. 1985).  In New Mexico, this species is considered \u201coccasional\u201d in the southern portion of the state and \u201ccasual\u201d at Las Vegas (Hubbard 1978).  In Utah, the first record of this species was in 1986 (Kingery 1987).  No additional records of this species in Utah were discovered.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhite-tailed Kites inhabit low elevation grasslands (grazed or ungrazed), agricultural areas, wetlands, oak-woodlands, and savannas (Dunk 1995).  This species typically nests in riparian trees adjacent to agricultural lands (Johnson 1987).  Two pair observed nesting in a row in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) trees (Gatz et al. 1985).  Also, it was observed nesting within an Emory oak (Quercus emoryi); nest height was ~10 meters (Gatz et al. 1985).  In the Lower Colorado River Valley, Arizona, this species typically hunts over agricultural lands and brushy vegetation bordering fields (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In New Mexico, vegetation type was described as \u201clow elevation wooded areas\u201d (Hubbard 1978).  This may be as a nesting requirement only; however, this was not specified by the author. \r\n\r\nThis species hunts in \u201copen areas\u201d including grasslands and agricultural fields (Johnson 1987).  Populations of this species may be correlated with rodent density (Dunk and Cooper 1994).\r\n\r\nIn Arizona, observations of this species range between 1000 to 3500 feet (300 \u2013 1060 meters; Johnson 1987).  In New Mexico, this species occurs mainly at \u201clower elevations\u201d (Hubbard 1978).  This species occurs primarily in southern Arizona with casual occurrences in New Mexico and one record in Utah.  The elevational range is estimated between 300 and 1060 meters.  N. Tarr, 9July20012.
