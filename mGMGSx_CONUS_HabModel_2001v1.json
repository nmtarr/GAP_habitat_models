It is most abundant in open coniferous forests, but\r\noccurs sparsely in dense forests, in certain areas of the desert shrub type of the Great Basin (McKeever 1964). It can be found in open habitats or sparsely brushy types adjacent to the pinyon belt up to timberline (Bartels and Thompson 1993). The speices also ocurrs on rocky slopes adjoining grasslands and in areas of dry, open, gravelly hillsides of scattered chapparal, sagebrush and mountain meadow margins (McKeever 1964). It will be found in recently burned or logged pine forests with scattered woody debris preferring the open habitats created for foraging on emerging, berry producing shrubs and flowering plants (Burt 1934, Cowan and Guiguet 1965, Gordon 1943, Grinnell 1918). Forest species associations include Ponderosa pine, Limber pine, Lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, Douglas fir, and quaking aspen. McKeever (1964) noted their absence in dense stands of spruce and fir.\r\n\r\nThe subspecies S. l. bernardinus in partcular occupies the upper transition and boreal life zones above 6500 feet throughout both humid and arid habitats (Mullally 1953). Dominant tree species associations include Jeffery pine, Western Juniper, Big sagebrush, Ponderosa pine, Sugar pine, White fir, Incense cedar, Whitethorn ceanothus, and Greenleaf manzanita. They are absent from areas of pinyon pine and Great Basin sagebrush (Mullally 1953).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nS. lateralis generally occurs in moist conifer forests but are also found along rockslides, in mixed forests above the timberline and in chaparrel country with dense stands of shrubs (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is also found in Rocky Mountain alpine and subalpine grasslands; not found in grasslands of lower elevations (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species prefers meadows in montane\r\nforests, but does occur up to the timberline and may descend into pinyon-juniper woodland (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Colorado S. lateralis also occurs in alpine tundra, semidesert and montane shrublands, and riparian woodlands; it avoids deep forests and prefers open areas (Bailey 1971). The species is found among aspen and white pine (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Zeveloff 1988). PNV-Avens-sedge and woodrush (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). S. lateralis eats the seeds of deers-ears (Swertia radiata), penstemon, Gilia, ponderosa pine and probably Douglas-fir, spruces, Frasera, grass, and any other available seeds (Bailey 1971, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Hall 1995). It also eats dandelion stems, aster, sunflower, larkspur, clover, vetch, monkshood, groundsel, sagebrush leaves, wild currants, bulbs of willowweed (Epilobium), chokecherry pits, acorns, oats, wheat, and barley (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Hall 1995, Zeveloff 1988). In Arizona it digs extensive burrows which usually follow along a live or dead and decayed root of yellow pine (Bailey 1971). The species needs suitable soil for burrow construction or talus, rocks, or logs for shelter; not found in extremely arid areas (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It inhabits rocky outcroppings (Frey et al. 1996). The home range varies from 1-12 ha (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The elevation is between 1220 and 3,695m (Bartels and Thompson 1993, NatureServe 2001). It is present in the Chuska Mountains, the Kaibab Plateau\r\nand the Mogollon Plateau in Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). S. lateralis occurs in the western two-thirds of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs in the Spring Mountains, the Sierra Nevada around Lake Tahoe, the northwestern corner, and the northeastern part of Nevada (Hall 1995). It is present in the Chuska, San Juan, Jemez, and Sangre de Cristo Mountains and on the Mogollon Plateau (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). The species occurs in Utah except in the\r\nsoutheast (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGMGSx", "ELCode": "AMAFB05170", "scientific_name": "Callospermophilus lateralis", "ITIS_TSN": "930305", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102855", "common_name": "Golden-mantled Ground Squirrel"}}
