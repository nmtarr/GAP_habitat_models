Most frequently encountered in sandstone, granite, and schist formations with deep, shaded crevices that are moist but not dripping wet.  They have also been found on quartize and limestone (Pentranka 1998).  Avoids permanently wet areas.  Often found in rock outcroppings surrounded by rhododendron & eastern hemlock close to stream valleys or cove hardwood communities.  Can also be found in upland pines, Virginia pine, and white-pine hemlock when there is a mountain laurel understory (Wilson 1995).   In addition, they may sometimes be found on adjacent trees or downed woody material, especially in mature forests.  They are sometimes arboreal.  Mating occurs in late spring and early fall.  Male-gravid female pairs occur in late spring and late summer-early fall (Canterbury and Pauley 1994).  Lays 10-30 eggs in late spring-early summer; in June in West Virginia (Canterbury and Pauley 1994) and North Carolina, by mid-July in southeastern Kentucky (Cupp 1991), in mid- to late July in Mississippi (Woods 1968).  Eggs are laid in rock crevices, rotting stumps, or similar dark, damp places.  Female stays with eggs until they hatch in 10-13 weeks.  Young hatch in late summer or early fall (mainly late August or September).  No aquatic larval stage.  Adult females evidently do not produce eggs every year (Canterbury and Pauley 1994).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGRSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD01010", "scientific_name": "Aneides aeneus", "ITIS_TSN": "173699", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103197", "common_name": "Green Salamander"}}
