However, in this study paratization rates were high in the floodplain nest location, which could account for the expanded use of upland nest locations. They also elucidated two additional studies in Missouri and Minnesota where there were similar results.  Wood ducks generally use shallow waters or waters edge. Anderson et al.

Although swamps, marsh, and overflow areas may provide better habitat than streams, the extensive distribution of streams creates the single most important habitat for breeding birds (Bellrose and Holm 1994). Current data suggest that structure and use of habitats are similar among seasons, but more quantitative information is needed on seasonal habitat use (Fredrickson and Graber 1990). Freshwater wetlands with an abundance of vegetative cover are important habitats in all seasons. Because of steep topography in the West, narrow riparian zones along waterways are important there (Bartonek et al. 1990)(quoted directly from Hepp and Bellrose 1995).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nGENERAL (Nature Serve):  Herbaceous wetland, lagoon, river mouth/tidal river (Estuarine), big river, creek, low gradient, medium river (riverine), shallow water (lacustrine), bog/fen, forested wetland, riparian (palustrine), Conifer, mixed, and hardwood forests and woodlands (Terrestrial).\r\nHabitat includes quiet inland waters near woodland, at areas such as wooded swamps, flooded forest, greentree reservoirs, ponds, marshes and along streams. Utilize large holes in large trees in forested wetlands, and in bird boxes within 0.5 km of water and near forest canopy.  Nests in tree cavities with at least 9 cm entrance, an interior basal area of at least 258 sq cm at a height of 2 meter or more above the ground. Elms and maples are important habitat components in most areas where they commonly provide protein-rich samaras in spring and suitable nest cavities. Often returns to the same nesting area and same nest box in successive years (moving to a new nest site after nest is destroyed).  Female may lead young up to several km to suitable habitat (food and cover). Important cover for broods includes shallowly flooded habitat with understory.  Commonly lays eggs in conspecifics\u2019 nest (Nature Serve).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nSummer resident and transient in western Nevada; winter resident in southern Nevada (Alcorn 1988). Colorado: common resident in Grand Valley, Mesa Co., and on eastern plains, breeding locally. Very rare at all seasons in western valleys oustide of Grand Valley (Andrews and Righter,1992). Habitat: reservoirs, lakes, rivers shaded by tall overhead vegetation. Narrow riparian zones along waterways in the West are important for this region (Hepp and Bellrose 1995). Freshwater wetlands with abundant vegetative cover important habitat all year round. Interspersion of flooded shrubs, water tolerant trees, small areas of open water resulting in 50-70% cover are favored. Beaver ponds are good habitat.  In areas where traditional habitats are lacking, birds use agricultural land and open areas. The birds are usually associated with flooded woodlands rather than open marshes. New Mexico: migrate and winter (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, 2000). This species occurs year round in Utah although it is more common in state during the winter (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, 2003). Wood ducks prefer marshes and ponds near woodlands and are especially fond of flooded fields.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nWood ducks will utilize a wide variety of freshwater habitats such as creeks, rivers, bottomlands, swamps, marshes, beaver and farm ponds (Hepp & Bellrose 1995). They generally prefer slow-moving waters surrounded by deciduous or mixed woods, especially where large willows, cottonwoods, and oaks are present (Anderson et al. 1981, Hepp & Bellrose 1995).\r\nNests in cavities in live or dead trees located in, near, or a distance from water (Potter et al. 1980). Trees are often older and larger than the typical second-growth. Frequently uses cavities made by Pileated Woodpeckers (Haramis 1990). Cavities are located 2-65 feet above ground, with those at least 30 feet above ground being preferrred. Depth of preferred cavities has been found to average 10-19 inches (Bellrose et al. 1964). Will also nest in chimneys or nest boxes (Potter et al. 1980). Upon arrival in breeding areas, migratory females forage intensively and built up nutrient reserves prior to nesting. Nests are initiated as early as late January in the south, early March in the Midwest, and mid-March to early April in the north. Clutch size is 9-15 (usually 10-12), but more than one female may contribute eggs to a nest, resulting in nests with many more eggs (commonly up to 30 for successful nests in nest boxes). Often two broods per year are raised in the south, occasionally in the north. Incubation lasts 27-37 days, by female. Females with broods commonly move a kilometer or more from the nest site soon after hatching. Most juvenile mortality occurs during the first few weeks after hatching. Young first fly at about 9 weeks, abandoned by parent at 1-2 months. Yearlings may breed but often unsuccessfully or not at all. Most of the above information is from Dugger and Fredrickson 1992).\r\nHartke and Hepp (2004), stated that natural cavities used by breeding wood ducks were located <0.5 km from the nearest wetland or shoreline, with most nest within <0.16 Km.  Ryan et al. (1998), found 82% of their study nest in upland woodland environments were located >1 Km from permenant water.  However, in this study paratization rates were high in the floodplain nest location, which could account for the expanded use of upland nest locations. They also elucidated two additional studies in Missouri and Minnesota where there were similar results.  Wood ducks generally use shallow waters or waters edge. Anderson et al.
