In the southwestern U.S., year-round residents occur in eastern Colorado and eastern New Mexico, and a western range expansion may have occurred due to anthropogenic habitat alterations (Tarvin and Woolfenden 1999).  Some fluctuations in winter distribution occur that may depend upon the productivity of mast producing trees (Tarvin and Woolfenden 1999).\r\n\r\nBlue Jays occupy deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests and woodlands in both rural and residential areas, especially those with oaks or other mast producing trees (Goodwin 1976, Ehrlich et al 1988, Hamel 1992, Harrison 1975, Kaufman 1996, Tarvin and Woolfenden 1999).  They particularly favor mixed woodlands containing oaks or beeches (Goodwin 1976, Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996) and are probably more strongly associated with woodland edges than forest interiors (Tarvin and Woolfenden 1999).  Kaufman (1996) reported that they avoid coniferous stands, but others reported that they were present in these habitats (Stevenson and Anderson 1994).  Other habitats used by Blue Jays include coastal scrub, river bottomlands, and swamps (Fernald 1989, Stevenson and Anderson 1994).  They forage both on the ground and on trees or shrubs (Kaufman 1996).  \r\n\r\nBlue Jays are abundant permanent residents across the Southeast.  In Colorado, they are known to inhabit forests and riparian habitats along streams and rivers (Kingery 1998).  In Illinois, Blue Jays were more abundant in developed areas than in surrounding mature forests (Tarvin and Woolfenden 1999).  They inhabit shelterbelts in the Great Plains (Tarvin and Woolfenden 1999).  \r\n\r\nBlue Jays usually place their nests in the crotches or branches of trees, shrubs, or vines approximately 1.5 to 15 m above the ground (Harrison 1975, Ehrlich et al. 1988, NatureServe 2004).  Both sexes build nests and will often reuse old nests (NatureServe 2004).  Nests are constructed of twigs, bark, mosses, string, leaves, pine needles, etc. and lined with fine rootlets (Goodwin 1976, Ehrlich et al 1988, Harrison 1975, Potter et al 1980).  N.
