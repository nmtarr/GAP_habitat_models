Foraging takes place in open, grassy areas (Emlen and Glading, 1945; Gorenzel et al., 1991) or in cultivated cropland (Emlen and Glading, 1945; Johnsgaard, 1973; Crawford, 1978; Stinnett and Klebenow, 1986), typically within 16 m of cover (Gutierrez, 1980; Gorenzel et al., 1991). Shrubs and trees are used for roosting and loafing (Emlen and Glading, 1945; Genelly, 1955; Leopold, 1977). Composition is less important than structure (Johnsgaard, 1973).\r\n\r\nSpecific habitats in which the species has been documented include: riparian woodlands and shrublands of willow and cottonwood (Emlen, 1939; Anthony, 1970; Stinnett and Klebenow, 1986); chaparral, including coastal, montane, and xeric (Johnsgaard, 1973; Leopold, 1977; Gutierrez, 1980; Calkins et al., 1999); coastal scrub (Calkins et al., 1999); oak woodlands and savanna (Emlen and Glading, 1945; Genelly, 1955; McMillan, 1964); pinyon and juniper steppe and woodlands (Emlen and Glading, 1945; Leopold, 1977); sagebrush steppe (Emlen and Glading, 1945; Leopold, 1977; Stinnett and Klebenow, 1986); forest openings created by logging or fire (Johnsgaard, 1973; Leopold, 1977); and abandoned, overgrown cropland (Stinnett and Klebenow, 1986).\r\n\r\nIn proximity to such shrub/grass habitats, California quail are known to inhabit the edges of: a Monterey pine plantation (Genelly, 1955); coastal redwood forest (Leopold, 1977); and mixed conifer forest (Gutierrez, 1980).\r\n\r\nThe species avoids dense forests and even thick shrubs (Johnsgaard, 1973) as well as sites devoid of herbaceous cover (Leopold, 1977). Extensive grazing that inhibits shrub growth also reduces populations of California quail (Leopold, 1977).\r\n\r\nC. californica have been documented at elevations as high as 2590 m (Calkins et al., 1999).\r\n\r\nAnother constraint on the species is distance to water. Leopold (1977) states that California quail require open water on a daily basis. He also asserts that they have a daily movement radius of 800-1200 m.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCAQUx", "ELCode": "ABNLC23040", "scientific_name": "Callipepla californica", "ITIS_TSN": "175876", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104472", "common_name": "California Quail"}}
