It can also be found in some islands off the coast of California and Baja California (Stebbins 2003). This species is found in damp coastal forests and open arid areas. Its range includes California through western Oregon and eastward to the dry portions of the Columbia River Gorge (St. John 2002). In Washington, the western skink occupies scattered patches east of the Cascades and in the Columbia Gorge. In Oregon, this species is much more widespread and is absent from coastal areas north of Cury County and the high Cascades as well as the extreme southeastern area (Storm and Leonard 1995). In Arizona, this species is restricted to rocky canyon bottoms and steep, rocky hills in Petran Montane Conifer Forest and Petran Subalpine Conifer Forest (Brennan and Holycross 2009).\r\n\r\nNW\t-Open pine, pine/oak forests and rocky edges of rivers.
