Sometimes this salamander will be found in forested wet areas away from streams.  Caves and crevices at the base of damp riparian rockfaces are also used (Martof et al. 1980). Occasionally found in swamps and lake margins.  They occur from 100 to 2000m in elevation.  Clutch size averages 20-60. Eggs usually are attached to undersides of rocks in running water.  The female stays with eggs until hatching (about 3 months).  The aquatic larvae metamorphose after about 2-4 years and are probably sexually mature within 1 year after metamorphosis.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSPRSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD06020", "scientific_name": "Gyrinophilus porphyriticus", "ITIS_TSN": "173715", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100971", "common_name": "Spring Salamander"}}
