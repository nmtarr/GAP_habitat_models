They are more common in northern hardwoods, cove hardwood, oak-hickory and mixed pine-hardwood types than grassy habitats (Trani et al. 2007). This species avoids hemlock forest presumably due to a lack of cover and food (Pyare et al. 1993, Trani et al. 2007). They are uncommon in coniferous woodlands (Linzey and Linzey 1971), agricutural areas and ecotones (Henderson et al. 1985). This species will utilize regenerating stands and corridors to move between their preferred mature forest habitats (Mahan and Yahner 1998). Chipmunks seek out rock work, dilapidated buildings, large rotting logs, and thick underbrush in open forest, at forest edges or in other wooded or semi-open habitats. They are generally within 100 m of permanent streams (Jones 1992). Mean home range size is 0.03 to 0.40 ha (Snyder 1982). Burrows are often at the edge of rocks, near the bases of trees, or under edges of building. Nests are generally constructed below ground in an extensive burrow system.  They breed from mid-March to early April and a second breeding period occurs from mid-July to mid-August involving young of the previous year. Gestation lasts 31 days. Litter size is 4-15 (3-5 most often) with one to two litters per year. They commonly live 2-3 years, sometimes 5-6 years.\r\n\r\nNortheast/Upper Midwest:\r\nTamias striatus occur in all deciduous forest associations and in hardwood stands within boreal forests in the northern part of their range. They avoid burrowing in low, swampy areas, preferring well-drained slopes for tunneling. Entrances to burrows are scattered among cover such as fallen logs, rocks, stumps or tree cavities (Wilson and Ruff 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mEACHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02230", "scientific_name": "Tamias striatus", "ITIS_TSN": "180207", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105245", "common_name": "Eastern Chipmunk"}}
