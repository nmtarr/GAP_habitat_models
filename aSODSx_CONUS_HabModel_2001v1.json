Have been found in springs, swamps, cypress heads, acid bogs and sphagnum, sloughs, steepheads, small tributaries, and mud-bottomed pools in floodplains (Means 1974, Neill and Rose 1949, Robertson and Tyson 1950, Rossman 1959, Petranka 1998, Mount 1975). Bottomland hardwood forests offer optimal habitats for this species. Uncommon in pine forest. This salamander is found in moderate to dense leaf litter and dead & decaying wood during all life stages. Occurs at the edges of escarpments where streams cascade or gradually descend to lower elevations (Mount 1986). In South Carolina, found in flatwoods swamp (Hall 1994). It shuns sand areas and one seldom finds populations along sandy-bottomed streams or in other moist habitats where sand predominates (Folkerts 1971). Restricted to the Coastal Plain. Inhabits broad spectrum of habitats when D. fuscus not present; when D. fuscus present, D. auriculatus populations are found downstream and not in steepheads; thus the occurence of D. fuscus in a drainage will predict whether D. auriculatus is present in the upper reaches of a stream or restricted to downstream environments. Breeds September-October. Lays clutch of 9-20 eggs. Eggs guarded by female. Eggs are laid under or in logs or in depressions under moss or other cover near water. Larvae hatch in early fall, metamorphose in late spring after aquatic period.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSODSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03020", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus auriculatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173637", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105932", "common_name": "Southern Dusky Salamander"}}
