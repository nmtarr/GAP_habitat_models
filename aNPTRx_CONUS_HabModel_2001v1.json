Found in some Channel Islands of California (Behler and King 1979).\r\n\r\nPreferred habitat is shrubs and grassy areas nearby water; elevational range expands from sea level to over 3000 meters (Behler and King 1979). Although named treefrog they seldom are found up in trees, they are usually found occupying the ground (Stebbins 1951). Breeding occurs in most aquatic habitats that include backwaters of large rivers, emergent marshes, golf course ponds, forested swamps, muskegs, irrigation ditches, ponds, lakes, slow flowing streams, supratidal pools, and wet meadows (Lannoo 2005). Breeding may also occur in slightly brackish waters, and in both temporary and permanent water bodies (Stebbins 1951). In the Sierra Nevada, acidic environments (pH 5.0) are likely not affecting egg survival (Bradford et al. 1994). \r\n\r\nIn Arizona, introduced populations are found in the Virgin Mountains and Phoenix and Tucson areas. The native distribution in the state are only found in marshes and backwaters along the Colorado River (Brennan and Holycross 2009).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aNPTRx", "ELCode": "AAABC05100", "scientific_name": "Pseudacris regilla", "ITIS_TSN": "207313", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105101", "common_name": "Northern Pacific Treefrog"}}
