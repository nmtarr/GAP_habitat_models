One study found a strong preference for mature forests over early successional habitats, and they may prefer swampy forests (Kricher 1995).  Forest types that are used by this species include; oak-aspen forest, oak-hickory-pine forest, oak-maple forest, American Beech-Yellow Birch-Sugar Maple forest, aspen forests, spruce-fir forests, northern hardwood forests, and regenerating clearcuts.  Black-and-white Warblers avoid recent clearcuts but tolerate some stand thinning and recolonize regenerating forests following clearcutting.  They are absent in forests that have been heavily grazed by deer (NatureServe 2009).\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of its range, this species appears to be most closely associated with relatively closed-canopied forests with tall trees, low shrub density, and an open understory (Kricher 1995, NatueServe 2009).  Within southeastern mountain regions, it is typically found in mature hardwood forests, oak forests, pine-oak forests, and cove forests and is generally more common in slope environments (Kricher 1995, NatureServe 2004).  In the Atlantic Piedmont and Coastal Plain, this species is typically found in swamp bottomlands and moist mixed forests where it often nests along hillsides or in ravines (NatureServe 2004).  In east Texas, it was found to be associated most closely with relatively mature pine-hardwood forests. Specifically, it was associated with increasing numbers of tree species, vegetation height, percent canopy closure, percent of sapling hardwoods, large tree density, and number of shrub species (Kricher 1995).\r\n\r\nHabitats that are used in the Northeast are slightly different than those in the Southeast.  In Maine and Michigan, it occupies relatively open forests that have a high density of shrubs.  In Vermont, it is associated with intermediate canopy closure and dense understory vegetation in American Beech-Yellow Birch-Sugar Maple forests.  In Pennsylvania, it is more abundant in mature than successional aspen and oak stands in managed forests, where its presence correlates with the density of understory trees and tall shrubs.   In Massachusetts, open canopied stands of Northern Red Oak-Red Maple with moderate shrub densities are preferred (NatureServe 2009). \r\n\r\nThe Black-and-white Warbler is classified as a forest-interior, area sensitive species, and a reported minimum patch size is 70 ha for breeding (MD).  However, during the breeding season the species has been observed in forest fragments as small as 7.5 ha and in narrow (< 50 m wide) riparian corridors.  The minimum size of continuous forest needed to maintain a viable breeding population is estimated to be 300 ha (NatureServe 2009), and Andersen et al. (1981) identified that forest tracts of at least 50 ha are needed to manage for the species.  Robbins et al. (1989) found that they rarely occur in forests that are less than 100 ha.  Black-and-white Warblers are more common on slopes (Palmer -Ball Jr. 1996) in mountians regions and in bottomlands elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis species uses a wide variety of habitats on its wintering grounds in Central America and the Caribbean; coastal forests, dry interior forests, wet forests, forest edges, pine woods, mangroves, riparian areas, wetlands, scrub habitats, urban habitats that provide plant cover or large trees, open areas, plantations of cacao, citrus, mango, shade coffee, and pine.  Uses early successional disturbed areas, mid successional forests, and mature forests (Kricher 1995, NatureServe 2009).  Despite the generality of its habitat associations during winter, it favors primary forest, where it is more abundant than in other habitats (Kricher 1995).  N.
