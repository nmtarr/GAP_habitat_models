The species inhabits meadows in montane forests, open pine-oak forests, wet sedge and grass meadows bordering marshes and open water in New Mexico (Thompson et al. 1996). In Arizona, it is found in wet to damp places such as wet, grassy areas, bogs, and marshes (Hoffmeister 1986). It occurs in Colorado in drier grasslands with forbs and sagebrush, though fewer in number (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  It is found in grama-galleta steppe - juniper-pinyon woodland mosaic in New Mexico (Thompson et al. 1996). PNV (BLM)-wet grassy meadows of yellow pine, red fir, Engelmann's spruce, hemlock, and lodgepole forests (Thompson et al. 1996).  In Nevada, the species prefers to live in ladino clover or strawberry clover rather than meadow fescue, when given a choice (Hall 1995). In the summer it eats mainly the leaves of forbs, and includes grasses, sedges, rushes and fungi (Zeveloff 1988, Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Grasses, bark, and twigs may become more important in winter in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  The species also eats the roots of sour dock in Nevada (Hall 1995).  This species is a mountainous species (Findley et al. 1975, Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). M. montanus occurs in the White Mountains in Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). It occurs in the mountains of western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found in the northern half of Nevada (Hall 1995). The species occurs in the upper San Francisco River drainage and in the San Juan and Jemez mountains in New Mexico, but is not found east of the Rio Grande in the Sangre de Cristo Range because of competitive exclusion with M. pennsylvanicus (Frey 2004, Frey 2005). The species is distributed throughout Utah (Utah GAP 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMOVOn", "ELCode": "AMAFF11021", "scientific_name": "Microtus montanus nevadensis", "ITIS_TSN": "180310", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101726", "common_name": "Ash Meadows Montane Vole"}}
