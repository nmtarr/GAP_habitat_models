Introductions in the US began as early as 1900. Currently, the largest populations exist in Texas with 14,163 animals reported confined on 268 ranches in 92 counties and free-ranging only in 1 additional county (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1992).\r\nCadman (1966) classified the fallow deer as basically a woodland species, preferring hardwood areas to coniferous forest, especially at high altitudes. The ideal habitat contained plantations in the thicketstage for daytime cover, and open woodland areas of hardwoods, or mixed conifers and hardwoods, with a ground layer of herbaceous and shrubby species (particularly brambles), all within the vicinity of pasture. On the Land Between the Lakes, the fallow deer generally preferred open, grassy areas or areas planted to a crop such as wheat, although brush was utilized for bedding and hiding. In summer, areas of new plant growth, newly mown places (Kentucky bluegrass), and newly plowed regions were especially attractive. On cold winter days, the deer fed in the open but retreated to forested areas during periods of cold wind (Terpening and Hawkins 1970).\r\nIn Alabama, Fallow deer can be found in a variety of habitats, but they have a preference for deciduous and mixed forests, interspersed with open, grassy areas. They require some tree cover for shelter and winter food (Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources).\r\nCAWHR describes habitat as: \"Fallow deer in California are yearlong residents of perennial and annual grasslands, coastal scrub, closed-cone pine-cypress, valley foothill hardwood, valley foothill hardwood-conifer, and valley foothill riparian habitats.\"([Elliot et al. 2005] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\nMorse (2008) found Fallow deer forage consisted mainly of oak mast and grasses and preferred maritime shrub while avoiding salt marsh habitats on Little St. Simons Island Georgia. Only two of the seven collared animals in Morse's 2008 study preferred maritime forest habitats year-round.\r\nIn Texas, Schmidly describes habitat: \"Fallow deer do much of their feeding in open, grassy areas but require tree cover and undergrowth for shelter and winter food. Deciduous or mixed woodlands on gently rolling terrain are best, but conifer forests may be suitable in some places. The Edwards Plateau region, with its mosaic of oak mottes, juniper brushland, and grassy areas is well-suited for fallow deer\" (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mFADEx", "ELCode": "AMALC05010", "scientific_name": "Dama dama", "ITIS_TSN": "552472", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101112", "common_name": "Fallow Deer"}}
