On Assateague Island, they frequent the loblolly pine forests and open marshes, but they are most often found in the myrtle, greenbrier, and poson ivy thickets at forest edge (Whitaker & Hamilton 1998). Feldhamer and Damarais (2009) describe habitat usage in Maryland relative to white-tailed deer: \"Sika deer in Dorchester County spend much time in marshes, dominated by saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), needlerush (Juncus sp.), three-square rush (Scirpus olneyi), and cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), as well as wet, lowland forests dominated by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). White-tailed deer occur more often in upland conifer cover and agricultural areas.\"\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, Schmidly (2004) describes habitat as woodlands of broad-leaved and mixed forests with dense understory and occasional clearings. The patchy brush and open grasslands of the Edwards Plateau and South Texas Plains are considered well-suited to this species where they browse on grasses, leaves, and tender shoots of woody plants including live oak, hackberry, wild plum, mustang grape, Texas sotol, greenbrier, Texas wintergrass, fall witchgrass, and meadow dropseed.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSIKAx", "ELCode": "AMALC01050", "scientific_name": "Cervus nippon", "ITIS_TSN": "180696", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104812", "common_name": "Sika"}}
