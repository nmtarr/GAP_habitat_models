Populations occupy foothills and mid-elevation mountains, but it is also found along riparian corridors of the White River-Arrastre Creek drainages in northern Kern County and south Tulare County. In the San Joaquin River in Fresno County, this species is found in association with live oak or valley oak in Kings River in proximity to Centerville. The populations located on the east side of the Central Valley in Madera County occupy annual grasslands (Stebbins 2003).\r\nEggs of this species are laid beneath logs, rocks, bark, and within leaf litter associated with water, and even seeps and streams margins (Jockusch and Mahoney 1997). These researchers have also reported that egg deposition sites (nests) were placed deep in rocks and grassy pastures in the southern localities, while sites located at higher elevations used a variety of objects as cover. Similarly, southern clutch sizes are smaller than northern clutch sizes. \r\nAs adults, gregarious salamanders are found in the oak woodlands of the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. This region is characterized by blue oak, interior live oak, foothill pine, incense cedar, ponderosa pine, black oak, and white fir. This species can even be found at their northernmost range to occupy sugar pine and sequoia forest. The southern localities are in arid rolling grassland characterized by scattered rocks and low rainfall (27 cm/yr).\r\n\r\nThis region is characterized by blue oak, interior live oak, foothill pine, incense cedar, ponderosa pine, black oak, and white fir.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGGSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD02120", "scientific_name": "Batrachoseps gregarius", "ITIS_TSN": "573576", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102297", "common_name": "Gregarious Salamander"}}
