The range also includes west and central Texas, north to southeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas (O\u2019Brien and Doerr 1986; Trauth and McCallum 2001). Well-established populations occur in areas surrounding relatively big river systems, low gradient streams, and shallow water pools. Riparian habitats include herbaceous, forested, and scrub-shrub wetland (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nThis species of alligator is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and leaf litter. Nests are built by using leaves, mud, decaying vegetation, rocks, and ground litter. These nests are located in close proximity to permanent water (Goodwin and Marion 1978; Natureserve.org). The habitat includes fresh and brackish marshes, ponds, lakes, swamps, canals, irrigation ditches, rivers, and relatively large spring runs. Basking takes place in or in close proximity to water bodies. Dens dug by alligators are commonly found on margins of lakes and ponds where they spend drought and winter periods (Brandt and Mazotti 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rAMALx", "ELCode": "ARABA01010", "scientific_name": "Alligator mississippiensis", "ITIS_TSN": "551771", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100172", "common_name": "American Alligator"}}
