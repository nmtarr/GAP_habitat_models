Disjunct populations occur in southwestern Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. Reports also include establishments in Chihuahua, Mexico (Natureserve.org). Populations from the Gulf Coast to southern Illinois are now identified as members of C. dorsalis (Starkey et al. 2003).\r\n\r\nThis benthic species is known to burrow in or using soil, fallen logs, and leaf litter. Females dig nests within a few hundred meters from permanent water sources (Congdon and Gatten 1989). Riverine habitats include big rivers, creeks, low gradient streams, and shallow water pools. Riparian habitats include forested wetland, herbaceous wetland, scrub-shrub wetland, and temporary pools. Preferred habitats are characterized by slow moving currents, soft bottoms, plenty of basking sites and aquatic vegetation. Populations are associated with ponds, marshes, swamps, streams, reservoirs, and lakes.
