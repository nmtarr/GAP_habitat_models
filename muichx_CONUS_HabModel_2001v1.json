Preferred habitat is among the conifers - yellow pines, white pines, and other conifers of high zonal position - which grow at an elevation higher than the pinyons and junipers \u2026.. A few, but not many, in thick stands of aspen, and at lower elevation, they were common about ledges of rock and were found in mountain mahogany and in rock slides\u2026 ventured into pinyon-juniper, but only a short way\u201d (Hall 1946).  \u201c\u2026 optimal habitat is open, subalpine conifer forest of whitebark, foxtail, limber, and bristlecone pines.  \u201cIn northwestern Colorado it occupies pinyon-juniper woodlands and montane shrublands, where it was considered uncommon\u2026 More commonly, it occurs in higher elevation forest-edge situations in montane and subalpine forests (especially lodgepole pine on rubbly moraines), and it sometimes ranges into the alpine..\u201d (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  \u201cin Arizona \u2026 in habitats of ponderosa pine, white fir, subalpine fir, blue spruces, and quaking aspen.  Near the rim of the Grand Canyon they sometimes live among pinyons, junipers, and scrub oak\u2026\u201d (Hoffmeister 1986).  Elevation:  6000-11,000 feet (1829-3353 m) elevation (Burt & Grossenheider 1976); in White Mountains of eastern California, 2650-3450 m (8200-11,000 feet) (CDFG 2003); in Colorado, 1980-3660 m (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In California, this species inhabits high elevation, open subalpine conifer forests in the Inyo and White Mountains and the southern Sierra Nevada especially on exposed slopes or ridges at or near timberline. Preferred conifer species include whitebark, foxtail, limber, and bristlecone pines. Elevation ranges from 2360 m to 3450m (Hock 1963, Johnson 1943, [Harris 1995] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In Colorado, T. umbrinus occupies montane forest, montane subalpine meadows, subalpine forest, ponderosa pine-Douglas fir forest, as well as pinyon-juniper woodlands and montane shrublands (Armstron 1972, Bergstrom 1988, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Braun et al. 2011). This species may also occupy riparian areas of cottonwood-willow river bottoms (Long and Cronkite 1970), and frequents rocky areas and talus slopes (Cary et al. 1980, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Braun et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Wyoming, T. umbrinus occupies spruce-fir forest edges of clearings and meadows, as well as cliffs above timberline (Negus and Findley 1959). In Utah, this species can be found in ponderosa pine to the subalpine zone and in conifer climax and subclimax upper montane spruce-fir forests, but is absent or rare in lower montane forest habitats (Hayward 1945, Braun et al. 2011).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mUICHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02190", "scientific_name": "Tamias umbrinus", "ITIS_TSN": "180209", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104775", "common_name": "Uinta Chipmunk"}}
