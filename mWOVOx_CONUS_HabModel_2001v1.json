Prime habitat includes thick leaf layers or grassy patches within beech-maple forest (Wilson and Ruff 1999). They can be found in \"park like\" grassy areas (Whitaker 1980). They are rare or missing from extreme coastal regions of southeastern states. Especially common in hedgerows and apple orchards, but also live in a wide variety of woodland to grassland habitats where there is adequate cover, friable soil, and a good food supply. For example, found over entire Savanna River Site area in old fields and hardwood forests where the soil is loose or where rich leaf mold is present. Thought to to be uncommon in pine plantations (Cothran et al. 1991). Occur in a wide variety of habitats varying from subclimax beech-maple forests with closed canopies and varying depths of leaf litter to grassy fields with many bushes, patches of brambles, and mats of honeysuckle. In Florida, rosemary shrubs, sand pine, and turkey oak are often used (Smolen 1981). Most foraging is confined to a 30 foot radius of the burrows.  Nine out of 62 males, and 10/69 females made movements of 200 feet or more. Burt (1940) stated that the normal home range is about 0.25 acres (Fitch 1958). Home range of Microtus, in general, 1000 square meters or less (Nowak 1991). They inhabit the upper reaches of tidal bays and rivers and also occur in upland pine and mixed forests, mountain meadows, fallow fields, orchards, gardens and tilled croplands with hedgerows or nearby woods (Golley 1962, Linzey and Linzey 1971, Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). From Trani et al. (2007): \"The woodland vole occurs in a diversity of woodland and grassland habitats throughout the South, but deciduous forest sites with mesic, well-drained soils and a dense ground cover of litter or vegetation are preferred (Smolen 1981, Miller and Getz 1969, Getz 1985, Rhoades and Richmond 1985, Linzey 1995, Haner et al. 1999). The species spends much of its time below the litter and humus layer where it burrows and nests. There are records of woodland voles at elevations >1,300 m in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. However, generally the species is found from 600 m in the mountains to near sea level on the Atlantic Coastal Plain (Linzey 1995, Ford et al. 2000, Bellows et al. 2001). It also is commonly associated with upland grassy areas, fencerows, railroad rightsof- way, cropland, and orchards.\"\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, this species is uncommon in the eastern and central parts of the state and occur in woodland areas where ground cover in the form of leaf litter and lodged grasses offer protection. They spend their time in underground burrows which may account for the distribution staying east of the zone of sparse rainfall (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWOVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11150", "scientific_name": "Microtus pinetorum", "ITIS_TSN": "180314", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100495", "common_name": "Woodland Vole"}}
