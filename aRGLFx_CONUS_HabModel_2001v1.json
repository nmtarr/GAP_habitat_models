Successful introductions have been reported along the lower Colorado River from the border with Mexico up to Yuma and east along the Gila River to the vicinity of Buckeye in Maricopa County, Arizona. Has been reported to enter Imperial County in California (Conant and Collins 1998; Dixon 2000; Stebbins 2003). In California and Arizona, this species of leopard frog is found in agricultural ditches, canals, sumps, drains, and on the edges of large slow-flowing rivers; one documented case of a fish hatchery (Jennings and Hayes 1994; Platz 1991; Platz et al. 1990; Rorabaugh et al. 2002). The preferred habitat in New Mexico are clear flowing streams or permanent pools within intermittent drainages maintained by springs, but also found in cattle tanks (Lannoo 2005). Texas populations are established along streams or rivers and in proximity to ditches, ponds, and cattle tanks (Garrett and Barker 1987). In the north of Guatemala, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula this species is found in a wetland occupying dry, wet and moist tropical forests, and also cenotes (subterranean chambers) with brackish water formed by the collapse of limestone roofing (Lee 1996).\r\n\r\nConsidered an invasive species in Arizona, it occupies river banks, cattle tanks, agricultural ditches, and canals found in Lower Colorado River Desertscrub in the lower portions of the Gila, Salt, Colorado, and Agua Fria rivers. Its non-native range is expanding thru Phoenix up the Salt River (Brennan and Holycross 2009).\r\n\r\nFound in streams, pools, springs, arroyos and their pools, and even stock tanks along the grasslands and woodlands it occurs in. Strong association with streams, temporary or permanent; breeding occurs throughout the year after rains (Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). Suitable habitat is any moist or water conditions, artificial or natural (Behler and King 1979).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRGLFx", "ELCode": "AAABH01030", "scientific_name": "Lithobates berlandieri", "ITIS_TSN": "775079", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106539", "common_name": "Rio Grande Leopard Frog"}}
