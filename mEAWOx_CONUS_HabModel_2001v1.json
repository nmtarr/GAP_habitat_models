In the mountains, they prefer deciduous forests, particularly where the understory is dense, and often occur in areas with rock outcrops, talus slopes or caves. Other habitats include low, wet areas, ranging from marshes (Svihla and Svihla 1933) to swamps and swamp hammocks (Bangs 1898, Harper 1927, Chamberlain 1928, Hamilton 1953). In the Coastal Plain, woodrats may be abundant in deciduous forests of floodplains, ravines, swamps and of forested areas near marshes (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  They are very common in the ecotone between hydric and mesic communites (Pearson 1954).  Within North Carolina, populations are most common above 3000ft (Clark 1987). It is also associated with rocky places where fissures and crevices provide shelter, but it is less restricted to rocky habitats than the Allegheny wood rat (Neotoma magister). Nests have been found in shrub and vine thickets, hollows of trees and stumps, subterranean chambers, barns and abandoned buildings, cave entrances, and among rocks on talus slopes (Clark 1987). They breed all year in Florida and coastal Georgia (Golley 1962, Pearson 1952, Schwartz and Schwartz 1981, Nowak and Paradiso 1983).  Gestation probably lasts about 33-39 days (Hamilton 1953). Litter size is usually 2-4 (average 3) (Pearson 1952, Hamilton and Whitaker 1979), with up to 2-3 litter per year. Sexual maturity is reached in less than one year and some females may breed in their first season (Wiley 1980). Adults appear to live at least three years in the wild (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981, Merritt 1987). Mean home range size, using minimum convex polygon was 0.70 ha with no difference between males and females. Male and female home ranges did not overlap. Sixty nine percent of all dens were located at an ecotone (HaySmith 1995). Most foraging occurs less than 75 feet from the woodrat den.\r\nKey Largo woodrats (N. f. smalli) are found exclusively in the native tropical hardwood hammocks of Key Largo. Almost all of the remaining habitat for this subspecies exists within Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge and Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park. Approximately 130 ha of habitat exists on private lands as of 2007 (USFWS 2008).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nOccupies a variety of habitats including lowland hardwood forests, marshes, mountains, coastal plains, swamps and grasslands (Wiley 1980). In Colorado, the eastern woodrat occurs on the eastern plains where it occupies rocky draws or riparian woodland and well-developed shrublands with yucca and cactus for shelter and food (Monty and Emerson 2003, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In eastern CO inhabit areas with little vegetation and rain, in the upper Sonoran life zone (Wiley 1980). Occur in a variety of habitats including upland woods, brushy riparian woods, wooded bottomland, swamps, and rocky bluffs with caves and crevices (Monty and Emerson 2003).  In Colorado, grasslands alone are insufficient habitat; found associated with rock outcrops or hedgerows (Monty and Emerson 2003). Houses are built under rock outcrops, brush piles, at the base of large trees, and in tangles of briars (Wiley 1980). Eastern woodrats occur predominantly in the east, however their range extends in Colorado. Eastern woodrats in Colorado are marginal populations (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  In the east, eastern woodrats are associated with deciduous forests (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Elevation minimum from CWSD and maximum from Wiley (1980). In Texas, this species is associated with mixed hammock and river bottoms of eastern TX living in burrows at the base of trees as oppossed to building stick nest. It is abundant in the flatland hardwood, hardwood-pine, and lower slope hardwood-pine forests of the Big Thicket region in southeast TX. It is also associated with upland post oak forests of east-central TX and frequents rocky canyon walls of mesic uplands and riparian habitats of the Edwards Plateau (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mEAWOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF08010", "scientific_name": "Neotoma floridana", "ITIS_TSN": "180372", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100518", "common_name": "Eastern Woodrat"}}
