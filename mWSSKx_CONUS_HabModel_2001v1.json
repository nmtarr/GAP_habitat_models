It occurs in all SWReGAP states, including montane regions of Colorado, all but the eastern extreme of New Mexico, and all of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona (Verts et al. 2001).  It has a broad distribution in mountains, canyons, foothills, and some deserts but is locally uncommon (Cahalane 1939; Armstrong 1972; Findley et al. 1975; Hoffmeister 1986; Hall 1995; Crooks 1999).  Little is known about the life history of this species (Fitzgerald 1994; Crooks 1999).  In the SWReGAP region, the western spotted skunk is found in a variety of shrublands and woodlands, usually in rocky or brushy areas of moderate elevations and fairly rugged topography.  In the Chiracahua Mountains of Arizona, the spotted skunk was found only in the low foothills of the encinal belt at the very edge of the desert, an area of steep, narrow canyons with oaks and junipers (Cahalane 1939).  Hoffmeister (1986) stated that this species may be found throughout Arizona, particularly in rocky areas such as the Grand Canyon.\r\nIn the Huachuca Mountains and surrounding plains it occurs primarily in the oak belt (Hoffmeister 1986).  The western spotted skunk is widespread in the canyons and foothills of Colorado's mountains, where it occurs in rough, broken, shrub-covered terrain, including montane forests and shrublands, semi-desert\r\nshrublands, and pinyon-juniper woodlands; it is numerous in Mesa Verde NP in some years (Armstrong 1972; Fitzgerald 1994).  In New Mexico, it is found in rocky, brushy areas within woodland, grassland, and desert zones, and is most common in the western half of the state (Findley et al. 1975).  In Nevada, it has been taken from rock slides within willow (Salix) thickets along rivers; there are no examples from the desert or sandy hills of Nevada even though suitable prey occur here (Hall 1995).  It is found in brushy areas in Utah (UDWR 2003), probably throughout the state (Durrant 1952).  Outside the SWReGAP region, the western spotted skunk is usually found in rocky areas as well as riparian zones. It is found most commonly along streams with rock piles and basaltic outcrops in Idaho, in rocky areas and willow-cottonwood (Populus) riparian thickets in Washington, in cliff, rimrock, and lava fields, and deciduous riparian areas in Oregon, in rimrock and oak-pine forests in central Mexico, and it has also been found in an arroyo within a tropical, deciduous forest on the west coast of Mexico (Baker and Baker 1975; Servin et al. 1995; Verts et al. 2001).  It may also occur in montane coniferous forests because in the Sierra Nevada of California, it was captured in a forest of red fir, western white pine, and lodgepole pine (Orr 1943) and west of the Cascades in Washington it may be found in all stages of the forest sere (Verts et al. 2001).  The California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System (Zeiner et al. 1990) states that it is found in \u201cnearly all habitats from sea level to the timber line, but frequents earlier seral stages of conifer and deciduous forests, and intermediate-canopy stages of brush and shrub areas; commonly found in grass/forb stages of most habitats, riparian areas, and many natural, and human-induced, herbaceous shrub and forest ecotones; and absent from many xeric areas of the Mojave and Colorado deserts (Zeiner et al. 1990).  The only habitat studies on this species in the U.S. are from the coast and islands of California.  On Santa Cruz Island, it preferred ravines within rocky canyons with coastal sagebrush scrub on the slopes, and it avoided grasslands and scrub oak (Crooks and Van Vuren 1995).  In urbanized areas of coastal San Diego County, it was detected rarely and only within large habitat blocks, which were canyons with chaparral, maritime shrublands, or coastal sagebrush scrub (Crooks 2002). Note that the eastern spotted skunk also shows a propensity for hillsides, and rock or log piles (Crabb 1948; Howard and Marsh 1982).  In coastal California, the primarily carnivorous western spotted skunk appears to be more restricted in habitat preferences than other more omnivorous mesocarnivores (Crooks 2002).\r\n\r\nThis species frequents rocky areas such as crevices of cliffs, canyons, rimrock, lava fields, or talus slopes, which it likely uses for den sites (Baker and Baker 1975; Hoffmeister 1986; Hall 1995; Fitzgerald 1994; Verts et al. 2001).  It also commonly takes refuge under buildings, in cellars, and in mine tunnels, and in\r\ncrevices around the base of man-made dams (Hoffmeister 1986; Hall 1995; Verts et al. 2001). It sometimes uses ground squirrel burrows (Verts et al. 2001) but it is also known to dig its own burrows (Crooks 1994).  On Santa Cruz Island, California, dens were in open grasslands, rock cavities, and burrows in roadcuts, as well as under shrubs, oak roots, and human structures (Crooks 1994).  Den-site selection was opportunistic and may not be a limiting factor, at least for the island subspecies from California (Crooks 1994).  The western spotted skunk occurs from sea level in California up to 2,744 m in\r\nMexico (Verts et al. 2001).  In the SWReGAP region it has been documented as low as 37 m near Gadsden, Arizona (Yuma Co) (Hoffmeister 1986) and as high as 2621 m near Hamilton, Nevada (White Pine Co) (Hall 1995).  Records are below 2438 m in Colorado (Armstrong 1972).  Hoffmeister (1986) lists one record at 3,353 m from the Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona but states that this elevation is questionable.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWSSKx", "ELCode": "AMAJF05020", "scientific_name": "Spilogale gracilis", "ITIS_TSN": "552466", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104420", "common_name": "Western Spotted Skunk"}}
