This species breeds in brushy areas, thickets and scrub in open country, open and riparian woodland, and chaparral, more commonly in arid regions but locally also in humid areas (Subtropical and Temperate zones) (AOU 1983), including country towns and farms.  Nesting occurs in cavities in trees, posts, woodpecker holes, crevices in buildings or among rocks, etc. Generally occurs at higher elevations of the Appalachians in farmyards, brushy places, openings and edges of woodlands, and overgrown fields. Bewick's wren was much more abundant and expanded its range northward in the eastern U.S. in the 1800s and early 1900s. Its habitat during this peak period was different from that of the current population. It played the role of 'house wren.' For example, in North Carolina during the early 1900s, Bewick's wrens commonly occurred in towns and farmyards at all elevations in the mountains (Pearson et al. 1942, Potter et al. 1980). Most of the North Carolina records since 1950 have been at elevations above 4000 feet, well away from human habitation, in such habitat as openings in forests or in pastures with fences and brushpiles (see Simpson 1978).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nIn the southwestern part of the range, primary habitats include chaparral, brushy slopes, pinyon-juniper, live-oak, and mesquite associations. In coastal California from Marin Co. south to Santa Cruz Co., found in greatest numbers in dense vegetation of northern sides of chaparral slopes (dominated by Baccharis; Miller 1941); also breeds in riparian thickets, brushy margins of oak woodland, mixed evergreen forests, conifer forests, and in hedgerows and suburban plantings, but absent from areas with dense overstory and from grassy areas that are devoid of extensive brushy draws (Shuford 1993). In Santa Clara Co., CA, most often associated with chaparral and scrubby areas, but adapted to both wetter Santa Cruz Mtns. and drier Diablo Mtns. (W. G. Bousman pers. comm.). In Monterey Co., CA, reaches greatest abundance on chaparral slopes of Santa Lucia Mtns; absent from heavily-developed areas (Roberson and Tenney 1993). In San Diego Co., CA, common resident in chaparral, pi\u00f1on-juniper woodland (dominated by Pinus edulis and Juniperus), and desert wash scrub (Unitt 1984). In se. California and w. Arizona, found in low brushy willow (Salix), sparse mesquite (Prosopis) and saltcedar (Tamarix) stands, and in tamarisk (Tamarix); also nests in brushy understory (primarily saltcedar) of mature cottonwood (Populus) stands (Rosenberg et al. 1991). In se. Arizona, found in riparian lowland and foothill areas with large trees (Strong and Bock 1990); observed in mesquite, elderberry (Sambucus), and dead brush near Nogales, AZ, and in pines, junipers, and oaks in Huachuca Mtns., AZ (Miller 1941). In sw. Utah, most common of 10 juniper-dependent species found in juniper community that is extension of pi\u00f1on-juniper community of Utah and Colorado (Fitton and Scott 1984). In Colorado, found in pi\u00f1on-juniper woodland and semidesert shrubland, and occasionally in sagebrush (Artemisia) shrubland away from trees; also found in lowland riparian forest in se. Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992) and in tamarisk in w. Colorado (D. Nelson in Andrews and Righter 1992).\r\nGenerally associated with dense, brushy habitats - thickets of mesquite, oaks, cacti and chaparral; mixtures of pine, junipers, oaks; dense growth of alder, cottonwood, and willow (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Brushy areas, scrub and thickets in open country, open and riparian woodland, and chaparral (Kennedy and White 1997). Broken and rather low brushy areas, especially where heavier cover is present overhead (Johnsgard 1992). It occurs from riparian areas through sagebrush to pinyon-juniper and oak-mountain mahogany habitats in the region, but is perhaps most common in pinyon-juniper woodlands (Johnsgard 1992). Resident in western and southern Nevada (Alcorn 1988). Common in western Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992). Pinyon-juniper woodlands, semidesert shrublands, sagebrush shrublands away from trees (Andrews and Righter 1992). In southeastern Colorado, inhabits lowland riparian forests (Andrews and Righter 1992). In Colorado, the species inhabit dry canyon and pinyon-juniper forests (Kingery 1998). Pinyon-juniper and mesquite-willow-cottonwood association in Arizona (Phillips et al. 1964). In western Arizona, found in low brushy willow, sparse mesquite and saltcedar stands, and in tamarisk; also nests in brushy understory (primarily saltcedar) of cottonwood stands (Kennedy and White 1997). In southeastern Arizona, found in riparian lowland and foothill areas with large trees; observed in mesquite, elderberry, and dead brush near Nogales, and in pines, junipers, and oaks in the Huachuca Mountains (Kennedy and White 1997). Permanent resident of lowland deserts and pinyon-juniper forests of southern Utah (UDWR 2003). Also breeds in northeastern Utah (UDWR 2003). Primary habitats in the Southwest include chaparral, brushy slopes, pinon-juniper, live oak and mesquite (NatureServe 2004). Bewick's wren preferred woodlands with high overstory juniper cover (Pavlacky et al. 2001). Occurs up to 2,134 m in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998). Found in the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas; Animas Mountains ;Sacramento Mountains; Manzanita Mountains; San Francisco; White; Huachuca Mts.\r\nWinter: In se. California and w. Arizona, found in sparse riparian habitats as well as desert washes; most numerous in mesquite (outnumbered by House Wrens in dense willows and saltcedar; Rosenberg et al. 1991). In se. Arizona, found in riparian lowland and foothill areas with scrubby vegetation or no trees (Strong and Bock 1990). In Mesa Co., CO, occurs mostly in tamarisk (R. Lambeth in Andrews and Righter 1992) (quoted directly from Kennedy and White 1997).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn ne. Kansas found in riparian areas in tallgrass prairie (Farley 1987, EDK, DWW). In Oklahoma, found in forested areas of old fields with junipers and few deciduous trees other than oaks (Pogue and Schnell 1994). In Texas, most common in thickets and brush in hilly, semiarid habitats; absent from excessively cleared urban areas (Oberholser 1974). In Chisos Mtns. of Big Bend region in sw. Texas, found in mixed brush, cacti, and small oaks (Miller 1941) (quoted directly from Kennedy and White 1997).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nAlong the northern Pacific coast, occurrences are in rough country, clearcut forests, and open second-growth, as well as in the vicinity of human habitations (Bent 1948). Western races generally in brushy areas away from humans (Miller 1941), although in British Columbia  nests mostly in buildings such as sheds, garages and barns, as well as in living and dead trees (Campbell et al. 1997). In Oregon, found in dense riparian areas with oak (Quercus) or ash (Fraxinus) overstory and dense understory, as well as in more open areas (Kroodsma 1973) (quoted directly from Kennedy and White 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBEWRx", "ELCode": "ABPBG07010", "scientific_name": "Thryomanes bewickii", "ITIS_TSN": "178562", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100618", "common_name": "Bewick's Wren"}}
