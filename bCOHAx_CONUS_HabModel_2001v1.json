Swamps and river floodplains are frequently used by these raptors (Layne et al. 1977, Stevenson and Anderson 1994).  Where openings occurred near nests, they are used for foraging, especially where hedgerows or windbreaks offer shelter for prey species.\r\n\r\nCooper\u2019s Hawks utilize urban and suburban areas, and forest edges are important during breeding (Curtis et al. 2006).  In some areas, the species seems to require large tracts of forests and to avoid human contact, but they use small forest tracts in areas throughout the country (Hennessy 1978 cited in Penak 1983, Herron et al. 1985, Campbell 1990, Peterjohn and Rice 1991, Rosenfield et al. 1991, Castrale 1992).\r\n\r\nA study of nests in New Jersey and New York found they were mostly in mixed deciduous-coniferous forests and tend to nest in areas with relatively large basal area and more canopy cover.  All nests were located in dense forest but commonly near wetland openings and on level ground or lower slopes. Most were several hundred meters from paved roads but sometimes within 100 m or less, and few nests had southern exposures (Bosakowski et al. 1992).  \r\n\r\nCurtis et al. (2006) reported that pine plantations are important habitat for breeding Cooper's hawks throughout the Midwest.  \r\n\r\nIn Colorado, this species nests in most forest types, from cottonwood riparian to spruce-fir forests at 3,048 m (Kingery 1998).  Pairs often nest in ponderosa pine, douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, aspen, spruce-fir, riparian forests, and pinyon-juniper woodlands (Kingery 1998). \r\n\r\nIn New Mexico, in fall and winter, the Cooper's Hawk occurs statewide, even in the high plains, using brush cover or hedgerows for cover.  It occurs in timbered canyons, ponderosa pine, and mixed conifer stands between 2,300 \u2013 2,380 m (Ligon 1961).  \r\n\r\nIn the lower Colorado River Valley, this species prefers extensive patches of riparian vegetation, especially areas with cottonwoods or other tall trees.  It appears to be dependent on mature cottonwood-willow groves for nesting (Rosenberg et al. 1991). \r\n\r\nIn Nevada this species is a summer resident in mountains and is a winter visitant to the valleys, but it has been reported nesting in canyons (Alcorn 1988).  The breeding grounds in the Great Basin are primarily higher than 1,500 m in montane riparian woodlands while the Mojave populations appear to breed at lower elevations (Ammon 2005).  This elevation restriction does NOT exist for wintering hawks in either region because they occur in deciduous woodlands and urban areas at all elevations in the winter (Ammon 2005). \r\n\r\nIn the breeding season, Arizona's Cooper's Hawks can generally be found in riparian habitats dominated by cottonwoods, sycamores, and oaks but also occur in woodland and forest habitats ranging from mesquite bosques to cottonwood-willow riparian forests and high elevation spruce-fir forests (Glinski 1998).  Nests may be placed in small oak or mesquite groves surrounded by little more than low yucca grassland and mesquite, and even rarely a large paloverde tree in the Sonoran Desert (Glinski 1998).\r\n\r\nIn winter, they are usually found in low-elevation pinyon-juniper forests, mesquite scrublands, and cottonwood cienegas (Glinski 1998). \r\n\r\nCooper\u2019s Hawks have similar habitat preferences to those of the Sharp-shinned Hawk but Cooper's Hawks are less selective about forest type than Sharp-shinned Hawks and are more often associated with deciduous and mixed forests and open woodland habitats such as woodlots, riparian woodlands, semiarid woodlands of the southwest, and other areas where woodlands tend to occur in patches and groves or as spaced trees (Johnsgard 1990).  Overlap in the distribution of these two species can exist.  A study in Missouri documented numerous Cooper's Hawks nesting in young pine plantations in essentially the same habitat as Sharp-shinned Hawks (Wiggers and Kritz 1991).  \r\n\r\nThere have been few studies on the winter habitat associations of Cooper\u2019s Hawks .  Curtis et al. (2006) reported that birds in Arizona occupy the same plant communities as those used in summer and that in southeastern and central Texas, overwintering (Nov-Mar) individuals inhabit canal banks and agricultural fields.
