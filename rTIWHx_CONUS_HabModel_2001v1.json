Degenhardt et al. (1996) note that the distribution of the species coincides almost precisely with the distribution of desert soils in the state. In Colorado, only occurs in the western part of the state, extending the furthest eastward along the Colorado River (Hammerson 1999). In Arizona, occurs throughout much of the state below the Mogollon Rim, although it is absent from extreme southeastern Arizona (Stebbins 2003). \r\n\r\nOccurs in a wide range of habitats across it broad distribution.  Generally found in arid to semi-arid shrublands and woodlands, including riparian habitats.  Specific vegetation associations noted include: open pinyon-juniper woodland; Great Basin desertscrub; sand dunes with mesquite, snakeweed, and yucca; open greasewood, sagebrush, and rabbitbrush; creosote bush and mormon tea (Ephedra trifurca); semi-desert grassland; and riparian areas with patchy shrubs and cottonwood trees (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Hammerson 1999, Lowe 1964, Persons and Nowak 2004).  Jones (1988) recorded the following habitats for Cnemidophorus tigris :  Ponderosa Pine Woodland, Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, Closed Chaparral, Open Chaparral, Desert Grassland, Disturbed Desert Grassland, Mixed Broadleaf Riparian, Cottonwood-Willow Riparian, Juniper / Mixed Shrub Woodland, Canotia Mixed Shrub, Mesquite Bosque / floodplain woodland, Mixed Riparian (Xeroriparian) Scrub, Mojave Desertscrub, Sonoran Desertscrub (Arizona Upland), Creosote Bush (Lower Colorado).  Soil ranges from sand to rocky alluvium.  Elevation range in U.S. from at least sea level-1675 m (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Hammerson 1999).  This species is found in Idaho and Oregon in the North West portion of its range. It is found in open areas in deserts and semiarid environments with a preference for sparse vegetation (Stebbins 2003). It can be found in arid pine forests in which there are open areas as well as around streams and in woodlands (Stebbins 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rTIWHx", "ELCode": "ARACJ02140", "scientific_name": "Aspidoscelis tigris", "ITIS_TSN": "208940", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102095", "common_name": "Tiger Whiptail"}}
