The species displays a preference for white fir (Airola and Barrett, 1985; Tatschl, 1967) and can be found in: Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests, including combinations of white fir, Jeffrey pine, red fir, douglas-fir, and sugar pine, with black oak (Bock and Lynch, 1970; Beedy, 1981; Airola and Barrett, 1985; George and Zack, 2008); ponderosa pine forests, either pure stands (Mills et al., 2000; Fischer et al., 2002; Johnsgard, 2009) or with douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, pinyon pine, and/or juniper species (Tatschl, 1967; Franzreb and Ohmart, 1978; Mannan and Meslow, 1984; Fischer et al., 2002); douglas-fir forests (Scwhab et al., 2006; Johnsgard, 2009), including those west of the Cascades and including components of western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, alder, and bigleaf maple (Hansen et al., 1995; McGarigal and McComb, 1995; Hayes et al., 2003); lodgepole pine forest (Salt, 1957); pinyon-juniper woodlands (Tatschl, 1967; Goguenn and Mathews, 1998; Johnsgard, 2009); aspen groves (Tatschl, 1967; Franzreb, 1975; Flack, 1976; Mills et al., 2000; Johnsgard, 2009); oak woodlands, including those association with pinyon and juniper (Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Tatschl, 1967; Anderson, 1970; Johnsgard, 2009); riparian woodlands (Tatschl, 1967; Williams and Koenig, 1980; Hudon, 1999; Carlisle et al., 2004; Johnsgard, 2009); and occasionally in Engelmann spruce-subalpine fir forest (Salt, 1957; Tatschl, 1967; Schimpf et al., 1980; see also: Carothers et al., 1973; Franzreb, 1975).\r\n\r\nBurned stands are not avoided (Hudon, 1999), though the species will only nest in live trees (Bock and Lynch, 1970) and is more abundant in unburned stands (Bock and Lynch, 1970; George and Zack, 2008). Thinning of stands, whether through logging (Franzreb and Ohmart, 1978; Hayes et al., 2003) or through insect damage (Stiles, 1980) tends to increase the abundance of western tanager, and this is specifically noted in the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\nWestern tanagers nest in conifer canopies (Tatschl, 1967; Bock and Lynch, 1970; Fischer et al., 2002) and forage within the canopy and in the air (Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Airola and Barrett, 1985).\r\n\r\nP. ludoviciana is found from elevations below 100 m, near the Pacific coast, up to elevations of ~3050m (Hudon, 1999; see also: Tatschl, 1967; Franzreb, 1975; Franzreb and Ohmart, 1978; McGarigal and McComb, 1995).\r\n\r\nWinter:\r\n\r\nThe few individuals that winter along the coast of southern California are found in suburbs, parks, gardens, and farms, specifically in groves of exotic trees, such as eucalyptus (Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Lehman, 1994; Hudon, 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bWETAx", "ELCode": "ABPBX45050", "scientific_name": "Piranga ludoviciana", "ITIS_TSN": "179882", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105777", "common_name": "Western Tanager"}}
