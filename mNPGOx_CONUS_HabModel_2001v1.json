Chromosome polymorphisim in of the Thomomys talpoides agrestis Merriam (Rodentia: Geomyidae).

The species is most common on meadows and grasslands and also do well in alfalfa fields (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Grass-forb rangelands from 2750-3350 m in elevation with at least 50 cm in precipitation are the most productive native habitats for the gophers (Zeveloff 1988).  It lives in high mountain meadows surrounded by spruce-fir or ponderosa pine (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It occurs in sedges, muhly, fescue, among needle-and-thread, Engelmann's spruce, blue spruce, pinyon, juniper, Douglas-fir, white fir, bristlecone pine, limber pine, Gambel's oak, and grama (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). T. talpoides is associated with Agropyron smithii and Aristida longiseta, and it may be associated with young cottonwood-willow habitat (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It is also found in aspen groves (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). In Colorado, 50% of the diet was plains prickly pear and the remainder mainly grasses (Zeveloff 1988).  T. talpoides also eats dandelion, yarrow, sagebrush, and penstemon (Bailey 1971). The home range is 0.02ha (Thompson et al. 1996). The elevation is 1,189-3,963 (Hall 1995, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). In  Idaho, T. talpoides occurs on lava-ash soil and sandy loam; claylike, dry areas and barren, rocky, sage-covered hillsides; loose, rocky, talus areas (burrows on average are less than 5 cm below the surface); moist humus along a stream; claylike lava ash; and sand (Davis 1939).  The species occurs on clays and clay-loam soils (Verts and Carraway 1999). In areas of sympatry with T. bottae in Colorado, T. talpoides occupied a larger area due to a greater tolerance of various soil types (Verts and Carraway 1999). The species shows a preference for light friable and dry soils or deep, soft soils; it avoids clays and wet soils (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Deep burrows may be more than 40 cm below the surface, while foraging burrows are usually 10-15 cm deep (Zeveloff 1988).  T. talpoides occurs on the Kaibab Plateau and in the Chuska Mountains in Arizona (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986). The species is present in the western half of Colorado and the eastern plains along the Platte-Arkansas Divide (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found along the eastern Sierra Nevada and the northern half of Nevada (Hall 1995). It occurs on Mount Taylor, the Chuska, San Juan, Jemez, and Sangre de Cristo mountains (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). The species is present in the northern and northeastern parts of Utah and along the Wasatch Mountains and Plateau, Fishlake Plateau, and in the mountains of Iron, Beaver, western, Kane, and western Garfield counties (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997). It occurs in the San Juan Mountains, Sangre de Cristo, Beaver, Toiyabe, Chuska, Ruby, Jemez, Mt. Taylor, San Mateo, Pine Forest Range, Monitor Range, Taos Mountains, Lukachukai Mountains, Tunitcha Mountains, Gallinas, Shoshone Mountains, Humboldt Range, Jarbidge Mountains, Virginia Mountains, Santa Rosa Range, Fox Range, White Pine Range, and the Culebra Range.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mNPGOx", "ELCode": "AMAFC01040", "scientific_name": "Thomomys talpoides", "ITIS_TSN": "180228", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104542", "common_name": "Northern Pocket Gopher"}}
