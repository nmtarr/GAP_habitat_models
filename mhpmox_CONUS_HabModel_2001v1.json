The American Society of Mammalogists, Mammalian Species No. 320: pp 1-4."}, "habitat_description": "Southwest:\r\nIt is found in grama \"short grass,\" scrub grassland, desert grassland, shortgrass plains, plains-mesa grassland, sacatan grassland, oak savannah, open areas with light bunchgrass, taller grasses and tall annual forbs, midgrasses, and warm temperate swamp and riparian forest (Frey and Yates 1996, Thompson et al. 1996). PNV- mixed \"shortgrass\", and Great Basin desertscrub (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996). C. hispidus is common in canyons in Oklahoma (Caire et al. 1989). C. hispidus occurs among cottonwood-willow, sycamore, cottonwood, rabbitbrush riparian habitats, sagebrush, tarbush, big bluestem, sand bluestem, tobosa, grama and buffalograss, galleta, ricegrass, dropseed, winter-fat, apache plume, redberry juniper, mesquite, gray oak, emory oak, and western live oak (Frey and Yates 1996, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It may possibly live in a mixture of yucca, ocotillo, mesquite, prickly pear, or agave (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). In Wyoming and Colorado the species inhabits silvery wormwood, yucca and grass, blue grama-needle-grass prairie, and disturbed sites like weedy ditch banks, hedge rows, and dry riparian areas (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It is likely that any available seeds may be cached, including blanket-flower, Gaillardia, and cactus (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It eats the seeds of mallow, legumes, sunflower(Helianthus annuus), Mammillaria and Opuntia, mesquite sagebrush (Artemesia ludoviciana), bluestem (Andropogon halli), witchgrass, evening primrose, winecup, Poor Joe, and sandbar grass (Paulson 1988, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Davis and David 1997). Pocket mice in general may go months without needing free water (Olin 1982). The species inhabits loose but gravelly soil on alluvial fans by the Huachuca Mountains (Hoffmeister 1986). The home range size is 0.24ha (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The elevation is 976-2,134m (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996). C. hispidus occurs in southeastern Arizona (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986). The species is found in eastern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is present south of the Mogollon Plateau in southwest New Mexico and from the Rio Grande east to the Texas border (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). In Arizona and New Mexico, the hispid pocket mouse occupies, denser mid and tall grass prairies and dense annual forbs (Paulson 1988, Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954, Rosenzweig and Winakur 1969).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains/Upper Midwest:\r\nIn Texas, this species prefers dry grassland habitats with sandy, friable soils and scattered herbaceous vegetation. However, soil type is not a limiting factor and the species can inhabitat rocky or gravelly areas with heavy soils (Paulson 1988, Blair 1937 Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954). Additionally, they can be found along fencerows, easements, and brushy fields provided grass and brush cover is not overly dense (Schmidly 2004). In other parts of the Great Plains, this species often occupies habitats with one or more of the following trees and shrubs: Yucca, ocotillo, juniper, mesquite, and Opuntia (Paulson 1988, Jones et al. 1983, Schmidly 1977). It is common in shortgrass and open bunchgrass prairie (Paulson 1988, Armstrong 1972, Kaufman and Fleharty 1974, Moulton et al. 1981, Schmidly 1977, Armstron 1972). They are tolerant of a wide variety of grassland vegetation types in Texas and Oklahoma, and have been found to avoid sandsage prairies in western Kansas where adjacent to cornfields (Paulson 1988, Fleharty and Navo 1983).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mHPMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFD05050", "scientific_name": "Chaetodipus hispidus", "ITIS_TSN": "552483", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106049", "common_name": "Hispid Pocket Mouse"}}
