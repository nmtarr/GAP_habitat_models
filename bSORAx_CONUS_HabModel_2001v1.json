The species\u2019 summer range includes the Northeast, Upper Midwest, northern and central Great Plains, and most of the West.  It is a resident year-round in limited areas in Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  In Colorado, it is an uncommon summer resident in western valleys, mountain parks and on eastern plains, and a rare migrant and summer resident in many minor parks in Colorado\u2019s mountains.  During the winter, it is very rare on the eastern plains, mostly near foothills, and casual in western valleys (Andrews and Righter 1992).  It breeds locally in central Arizona and New Mexico (Davis 1997).  It is also present in New Mexico during winter but is less common.  It is common in proper habitat throughout Utah during summer but is rarely found in state during winter.  Reported elevation limits for this species are up to 2,745 m in Colorado (Kingery 1998) and below 2,000 m in Nevada (Ammon 2005). \r\n\r\nThe Sora primarily breeds in freshwater wetlands but brackish or salt marshes with smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) or common reed (Phragmites communis) are occasionally used for breeding along the Atlantic Coast.  Nests were an average of 15 cm above water level in marsh vegetation, often near open water and anchored to emergent plants or sometimes placed on top of a mound (Cogswell 1977).  Typical freshwater habitat has both shallow and intermediate water depths and is dominated by cattails (Typha spp.), sedges (Carex spp., Cyperus spp.), blue-joint (Calamagrostis spp.) burreeds (Sparganium spp.) and bulrushes (Scirpus spp.; Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  Other habitats are used less frequently such as bogs, fens, wet meadows, and flooded fields (Davis 1997, Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  The presence of cattail is correlated with high breeding densities, and where cattail is rare, Carex sedges provide optimal habitat (Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  Soras prefer to nest in cattails and sedges near the edges of water, along ecotones of wetland vegetation type, or in wetland vegetation that is composed of a mix of large and small stemmed plants (Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  Non-wetland habitats adjacent to wetlands may be used for foraging habitat.  These include row crops, upland fields and mudflats (Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  Soras breed in seasonal or semipermanent prairie potholes of North Dakota and Iowa (Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  They primarily use cattail marshes in Colorado but nest locally in grassy or sedge marshes, wet meadows and irrigated hayfields, especially in mountain parks.\r\n\r\nDuring migration, Soras use freshwater emergent wetlands and brackish or salt marshes.  Stands of wild (Zizanna spp.) and cultivated (Oryza sativa) rice and flooded annual grasses or forbs provide important feeding habitats for migrants (DeGraaf and Rappole 1995). \r\n\r\nFreshwater, brackish, and salt marshes are also used during winter as well as vegetated canals and ditches, rice fields, impoundments, mangroves, wet pastures, overgrown and cultivated fields, emergent vegetation along edges of small ponds and rivers, swamps, along slough borders, and in mangroves.  In southwest Arizona along the Colorado River, they are usually found in shallow wetlands with cattail and bulrush but sometimes they occupy shrubby areas near wetland edges (Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  They are uncommon transients and winter residents in Colorado\u2019s desert lowlands on cattail lined ponds and marshy areas (Andrews and Righter 1992).   \r\n\r\nSoras are not sensitive to wetland size as they have been found to use even very small marshes (e.g., 4 nests have been found in a half-acre marsh) (Brewer et al. 1991, Melvin and Gibbs 1996).  \r\n\r\nN.
