Region is level or gently rolling, covered mainly by expanses of pine of various sizes interspersed with openings and clumps of pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), red maple (Acer rubrum), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). Prefers homogeneous tracts of great size, but has nested in tracts < 30 ha although more successful on tracts >200 ha. Species first appear in jack or red pine stands about 6 yr post-disturbance (i.e. fire, harvest-planting) where the new growth is most dense and the prevailing height is 1.5\u20132.0 m. Tracts then continue to be occupied for about 15 yr when trees are 3\u20135 m or taller and lower limbs dying where shaded. Warblers occupy densest stands first but persist longer in more open tracts. Last residents of a tract are unmated males (Mayfield 1960). During migration usually seen in low broad-leaved scrub in semi-open locations (quoted directly from Mayfield 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bKIWAx", "ELCode": "ABPBX03180", "scientific_name": "Dendroica kirtlandii", "ITIS_TSN": "178917", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102456", "common_name": "Kirtland's Warbler"}}
