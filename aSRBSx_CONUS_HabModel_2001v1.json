They are often most abundant in terrain features such as coves, ravines, riparian zones and caves, that provide some insulation from high summer temperatures.  They can also be found in abundance in mesic forests with plentiful dead and down wood, leaf litter and other debris on the forest floor.  In dry summer months, red-backed salamanders occur in and near damp areas.  Red-backed salamanders prefer cool temperatures, and are most active above ground in late winter and early spring.  In the Georgia piedmont, courtship and mating occur in winter or early spring. In Louisiana, this speices is found on slopes littered with sandstone rocks and sandy/clay soils in longleaf pine yaupon, and oak forests (Keiser and Conzelmann 1969, Beamer and Lannoo 2005). In Arkansas, P. serratus are found in leaf duff and under logs. They also are found in leaf packs along the margins of small streams (Thurow 1957, Beamer and Lannoo 2005). They lay a clutch of up to about 15 eggs (normally about 5-6 in Georgia, 6 in Ouachita Mountains) in June-July in moss or a rotten log, or under a rock.  The female stays with the eggs until hatching and the larval stage is passed in the egg.  Hatching occurs in late summer, 7-8 weeks after oviposition (Georgia). They reach sexual maturity in about 2 years.  The oogenic cycle is apparently annual in the Georgia piedmont and in the Ouachita Mountains (Camp 1988, Taylor et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSRBSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12160", "scientific_name": "Plethodon serratus", "ITIS_TSN": "173668", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103304", "common_name": "Southern Red-backed Salamander"}}
