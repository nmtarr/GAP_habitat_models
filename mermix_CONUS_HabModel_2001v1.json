Dens are created beneath stone walls, rock piles, under logs or abandoned buildings (Godin 1977).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\nHabitat generally includes forest edges, meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks. Ermines are well adapted to snowy environments and will utilize small mammal runways under the snow to track prey (Erlinge 1981, Fitzgerald 1977, Simms 1979, King 1983). In Michigan, ermine prefer woodlands near rivers, marshes, shrubby fencerows, and open areas adjacent to forests or shrublands (Baker 1983)\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Montana, this species inhabits brushy or wooded areas not far from water. They tend to avoid dense forests (although are apparently prone to montane forest associations) and and are most abundant in ecotones. Dens are below ground burrows under stumps, rock piles, hollow trees, or old buildings (Montana Natural Heritage Program 2014).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe ermine is a boreal, circumpolar species primarily of the Holarctic ecoregion (King 1983; Svendsen 2003) but it occurs in all 5 SWReGAP states in mountainous areas. Known from Colorado (Hall 1981; Fitzgerald et al. 1994), Nevada (including Lake Tahoe Basin) (McDonald and Brown 1992; Hall 1995; Catalano, pers. Comm. 2005), Utah (Durrant 1952; McDonald and Brown 1992; Svendsen 2003), and northern New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975; Frey 2004).  Range limits in Utah are unknown (Durrant 1952). Has been verified from the San Juan, Jemez, and Sangre de Cristo mountains of New Mexico and possibly occurs in the Sandia mountains (Stuart, pers. Comm., 2005). It was not known from Arizona until Berna (1991) indicated its presence on the Kaibab Plateau of northern Arizona. Southern range limits may be a result of interference from the long-tailed weasel (Simms 1979).  Little is known about the ecology of this species in the southern Rocky Mountains (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). \r\nFound in broad range of vegetation types from tundra to coniferous forests to parklands, but the crucial factor in its distribution is the abundance of small rodents (Zeveloff 1988; Doyle 1990; Murray 1999). Across its range, this species can be found in boreal forests, agricultural lowlands, woodlands, meadows, and in montane zones but it avoids deserts and extremely dense coniferous forests (King 1983; Zeveloff 1988; Svendsen 2003). Adapted to snow conditions; it can burrow in soft snow or run on surface if compacted and it enters subnivean runways of small mammals when hunting (King 1983). Typically found in greatest numbers along forest edge and linear habitats among scrub, alpine meadows, marshes, riparian woodlands, hedgerows, and riverbanks (King 1983; Zeveloff 1988; Silva 2001; Svendsen 2003). Small streams, ditches and culverts serve as runways, especially when dry in summer and frozen in winter (Rust 1968; Clevenger et al. 2001). Usually found in forests of mountainous areas in the SWReGAP region but has been found both above the forest zone (above timberline) and below the forest zone (in the foothills) (Armstrong 1972; Hall 1995). Occurs in alpine tundra and subalpine forests in Colorado; in both Colorado and Utah it has been trapped in meadows, including moist hay meadows interspersed with willow (Salix) stands (Durrant 1952; Willey 1970; Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Utah it prefers wooded stream sides (UDWR 2003).  In New Mexico, it\u2019s been found predominantly in subalpine coniferous forests (spruce-fir), but also in montane meadows, rock slides, and white fir-Douglas fir (Abies concolor-Pseudotsuga menziensii) (Findley et al. 1975; BISON-M 2002).  The single record from Arizona was in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) mixed with aspen (Populus tremuloides) (Berna 1991). In Nevada, it occurs in the boreal zone but does range down to upper edge of the sagebrush (Artemisia) and just below mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolia); also taken from small talus area, alpine fell field, and from herbaceous streambank within red fir (Abies magnifica)-aspen belt in Nevada (Hall 1995; Geluso 1997). Little is known of the species in Nevada (Catalano, pers. Comm., 2005). In British Columbia it occurred in mixed Douglas fir-lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) (Sullivan et al. 2000).\r\nElevation records in the SWGAP region range from 1615 m in Denver, Colorado up to 3962 m at Argentine Pass, Colorado (Armstrong 1972). Across the species entire range it is found from sea level (Murray 1999) up to 4000 m (Svendsen 2003).  However, it is found only in mountainous areas at lower latitudes (King 1983) and not in deserts (Svendsen 2003); therefore, we used the species lowest elevation record from the 5-state region (1600 m) rather then the range-wide low of 0 m.\r\nIn California this species is a uncommon to common, yearlong resident of the Sierra Nevada, Klamath, and North Coast Ranges (Ingles 1965). It is found from sea level to 3800 m (0-12,500 ft) and occurs in various pine and fir forest habitats, including mixed conifer, red fir, lodgepole pine, and subalpine conifer (Seymour 1968, Burt and Grossenheider 1976). They prefer cover provided by cavities in stumps, logs, rocky areas, or under human structures.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mERMIx", "ELCode": "AMAJF02010", "scientific_name": "Mustela erminea", "ITIS_TSN": "180555", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103237", "common_name": "Ermine"}}
