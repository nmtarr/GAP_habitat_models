In Colorado, the Hopi chipmunk is a common species of much of the canyon and sliprock pinyon-juniper country in western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Population densities appear to be highest in areas with an abundance of broken rock or rubble at the base of cliff faces or in rock formations with deep fissures and crevices suitable for den sites (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Hopi chipmunks typically do not stray very far from these rocky areas (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Inhabits bare or vegetated rocky substrates; associates with Utah juniper, pinyon pine, blackbrush, Mormon tea, bigelow sage, mountain mahogany, alderleaf, rabbitbrush, cliff rose, simple-leafed ash, matchweed, cactus, bigelow aster, galleta grass, Indian ricegrass, needle-and-thread grass, alkali sacaton, dropseed, fourwing saltbrush, Fremont\u2019s bareberry, Russian thistle, sunflower and cheatgrass (Burt and Best 1994). Nest sites are associated with piles of broken rock or crevices in solid rock (NatureServe). Home range in southeastern Utah was estimated at 0.4-1.3 ha (NatureServe); and 0.5- 1 ha based on dye-marked animals in Utah (Wadsworth 1969, 1972 in Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Found at elevations of about 1290-2700m (Burt and Best 1994).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mHOCHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02240", "scientific_name": "Tamias rufus", "ITIS_TSN": "552503", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106127", "common_name": "Hopi Chipmunk"}}
