This species can be found from northern Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan southward to east-central Missouri, southern Illinois, and central Indiana (Harding 1997; Minton 2001; Oldfield and Moriarty 1994; Vogt 1981). The second region occupied by this species extends from the Great Lakes basin in southern Ontario, the southeastern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan, and northern Ohio to areas near Saginaw Bay (Michigan) and Georgian Bay (Ontario), eastward along northern Lake Erie to Long Point Bay (Ontario) and along southern Lake Erie County, Ohio (Conant 1938; 1940; 1951; Harding 1997;).\r\n\r\nThis is a snake that can be found in herbaceous wetland and riparian zones; also in cropland, hedgerow, forest woodland, forest edge, savanna, shrubland, chaparral, sand dunes, old field, grassland, herbaceous, and various and mixed woodlands. This species is known to burrow in or using soil, fallen logs, vegetative debris, standing snag, and hollow trees.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern portion of its range, this snake is found along shoreline marshes and vegetated dunes and beaches of the Great Lakes. Harding (1997) has reported that this species will venture into adjacent farm fields, pastures, and woodlots. It can also be found in rocky areas and open woodlands on Lake Erie islands. This species rarely climbs into trees or shrubs. In the western portion of its range, habitats are mostly characterized by dry and moist areas of farmland, pastures, prairie, open woodland (hardwoods, pines), forest edge, wooded areas near streams, stream valleys, pine barrens, oak savanna, and sandy oak scrub (Harding 1997; Minton 2001; Oldfield and Moriarty 1994; Vogt 1981). Vogt (1981) also concluded this snake may spend significant amounts of time in burrows and on the ground; it hibernates in crevices, burrows, old wells, and sometimes under water. The eggs are laid in old stumps, under logs, humus, and other objects on the ground.\r\n\r\nUM-\tForest woodland, forest edge, herbaceous wetland.\r\nSE-\tFarmland, pastures, prairie, open woodland, pine barrens, and savanna.\r\n\r\nWe modeled the eastern foxsnake at Pantherophis gloydi.
