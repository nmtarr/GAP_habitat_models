Both coniferous and deciduous forests are used equally (Wilson 1995). It is known to breed in cypress-tupelo swamps, bottomland hardwoods (Mount 1986), floodplain forests with numerous oxbows and cut-off stream channels, the borders of ponds and streams (Bishop 1941), and low hammocks (Mount 1975).  In South Carolina, it is found in the vicinity of small spring fed streams (Hall 1994).  They are sometimes also observed in drier situations and can be found on rocky bluffs and slopes and wooded sand dunes.  Marbled salamanders require a breeding habitat characterized by winter flooding, and prefer locations with abundant leaf litter and fallen logs for shelter.  This species is a late summer or fall breeder.  Mating often occurs before female arrives at pond-basin nesting areas (Krenz and Scott, 1994). Lays up to about 250 eggs, which are usually brooded by female until nest is flooded (though nest desertion prior to flooding is common). Larvae hatch in fall-spring, depending on when rains flood nest, metamorphose in spring or summer. In South Carolina, reproductive success varied among different years.  Little or no recruitment occurred during drought periods (Pechmann et al. 1991).  Food limitation may reduce individual female reproductive output (Scott and Fore 1995).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aMASAx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01100", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma opacum", "ITIS_TSN": "173591", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104610", "common_name": "Marbled Salamander"}}
