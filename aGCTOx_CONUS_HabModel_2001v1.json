There are reports of disjunct populations in the Big Bend region of Texas and on the border of Arkansas and Louisiana; others in south Missouri (Conant and Collins 1998).\r\nFrequently found railroad, roadside, and irrigation ditches. Also found in coastal prairies, barrier beaches in the Gulf of Mexico, even in the outskirts of towns and cities. Sometimes found in dumps and storm sewers (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding occurs in standing water, temporary wetlands, ditches, and even artificial reservoirs, but also along edges of rivers. Reproduction is known to occur in brackish waters as well (Lannoo 2005). Found up on oak trees 2-5 meters in height where they occupy their holes. Invasive vegetation does not seem to have a negative impact on this species. Adults are sometimes found in the vegetated areas of coastal barrier islands within 30 meters of saltwater (Personal observations in Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nLannoo 2005 describes the coastal-plain toad (Bufo nebulifer) to occupy a wide variety of habitats along the Gulf Coastal Plain from central Veracruz to north central Texas, extending well into southern Louisiana and extreme southwest Mississippi; Considered accidental introduction, In Texas, it occurs in the Hill Country of the Edwards Plateau area and along the Rio Grande system near El Paso, Texas (Dixon 2000). Populations in northern Louisiana and south Arkansas are the result of dispersal using river systems (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGCTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01240", "scientific_name": "Ollotis nebulifer", "ITIS_TSN": "775988", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105649", "common_name": "Gulf Coast Toad"}}
