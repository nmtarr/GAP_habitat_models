They have been found at depths to 17 meters in Lake Erie (Pfingsten and White 1989) and 27 meters in Green Bay, Lake Michigan (Reigle 1967)(Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nMudpuppies are completely aquatic salamanders that can be found in clear or turbid waters of medium and large streams, canals or ditches, and in mud-bottomed ponds, lakes and other reservoirs (Martof et al. 1980, Petranka 1998). Mudpuppies prefer locations possessing abundant underwater cover in the form of rocks, logs, leaf litter or other debris. They are bottom dwellers and are often under rocks, debris, and bank overhangs during daylight. They may move into slack water shallows in late fall and early winter and may move upstream to spawn (Green and Pauley 1987). Their Eggs are attached to the undersides of objects in water. They lay a clutch of about 20-200 eggs in spring or early summer. The eggs hatch in 5-9 weeks and the female may attend eggs until hatching. Paedomorphic, attains sexual maturity in 4-6 years.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aMUDPx", "ELCode": "AAAAE01040", "scientific_name": "Necturus maculosus", "ITIS_TSN": "173630", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102563", "common_name": "Mudpuppy"}}
