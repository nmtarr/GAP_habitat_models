In the SWReGAP region it is found in northern Arizona just along the Utah border (Hoffmeister 1986), in the West Desert of west-central Utah and in the sw corner of Utah (Durrant 1952), and throughout Nevada except for a small area in the northeast part of the state (Hall 1995). \r\nThis heteromyid is most frequently found in shadscale (Atriplex spp.) communities in desert valleys because it has specialized teeth for removing the hypersaline outer tissue of the leaves of this shrub (Johnson 1961; Kenagy 1973; Hoffmeister 1986; Hayssen 1991).  Also occurs in desert washes, shrublands with creosote bush (Larrea spp.), greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.), inkweed (Sueda spp.), or sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), and in upland desert areas with deciduous blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) or hopsage-Andersons matrimony vine (Grayia-Lycium) (Beatley 1976;  O\u2019Farrell 1980; Hoffmeister 1986; Hayseen 1991; Jones and Longland 1999).  Has been taken in limited numbers from sagebrush-steppe, mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), the lower edge of the pinyon-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus) belt, and scattered juniper mixed with sagebrush and/or grasses (Durrant 1952; Beatley 1976; Csuti 1979; Hoffmeister 1986; O\u2019Farrell and Clark 1986; Hayseen 1991; Hall 1995).  It has also been found in open sandy areas, dunes, and yucca belts (Hoffmeister 1986; Hayssen 1991). It is not usually found in true salt flats/playas devoid of vegetation (Hall 1995).  Requires good shrub cover and is negatively associated with abundance of grasses (Hoffmeister 1986).\r\nElevation range is from 853 m in Utah (Durrant 1952) up to 2134 m in Nevada (Hall 1995).  Exceptional upper limit record of 3200 m from Inyo-White Mountains of California but this is primarily a species of moderate elevations (Hayseen 1991); 90% of records in Nevada are between 1066 m and 1981 m (Hall 1995).  The model uses a moderate elevation range specific to the SWReGAP states.\r\nSemi-fossorial (Hayssen 1991) but occurs in a wide variety of soils, including sand (Durrant 1952; Beatley 1976), sand with boulders or cobbles, silt loam or sandy loam (from alluvial deposits) with or without surface pavement or coarse fragments in the subsoil  (Beatley 1976), and compact rocky soil (O\u2019Farrell 1980).  Rocky slopes and gravelly floors of the low desert probably facilitate digging (O\u2019Farrell 1980; Ports and Ports 1989; Hayssen 1991). The soils layer is not used in the model because the species does not appear to be tied to a particular soil type.\r\nIn California, this species is found primarily in sagebrush and desert scrub, but can also occur in pinyon-juniper habitats to a lesser extent. They avoid steep slopes and burrow in sandy or gravelly soils. Distribution is limited by a combination of suitable soils for burrowing as well as presence of preferred succulent-leaved forage shrubs such as those of Atriplex confertifolia (Brylski et al. [CAWHR 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCTKRx", "ELCode": "AMAFD03020", "scientific_name": "Dipodomys microps", "ITIS_TSN": "180242", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102909", "common_name": "Chisel-toothed Kangaroo Rat"}}
