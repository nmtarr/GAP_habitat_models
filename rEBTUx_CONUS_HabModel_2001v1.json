Found in deciduous woodlands, old fields, marshes, pastures, and seasonally in areas between forests and old fields of the eastern coastal areas of Massachusetts to southern Georgia, westward into Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and northeastern Mississippi. Also found in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Long Island and into extreme southeastern New York and most of New Jersey (Hulse et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nSites suitable for egg laying are often characterized by sandy or loamy soils found in wide open areas. Females migrate from bottomlands to warmer and drier areas to nest (Stickel 1989). This species in known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and fallen vegetation. They also burrow into loose soil, mud, stumps, and debris. In general. The habitats this species is associated with include cropland, hedgerow, grassland, conifer forest, hardwood forest, mixed forest, conifer woodland, hardwood woodland, and mixed woodland (Natureserve.org). Populations are well established in areas that include fields, forest-brush and forest-field ecotones. Usually a migration pattern is evident from fields in the spring to forests in the summer (Natureserve.org; Stickel 1989).\r\n\r\nNE\t-Cropland, hedgerow, mixed forests, and various grasslands (herbaceous).\r\nSE\t-Hardwood forest, conifer woodland, grassland, and herbaceous prairies.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEBTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAD08010", "scientific_name": "Terrapene carolina", "ITIS_TSN": "173776", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100312", "common_name": "Eastern Box Turtle"}}
