They are most frequently encountered in the floodplains of small streams, muck bottomed ponds, intermitent streams (Neill 1964) and alluvial swamps.  Can be found in larger streams at the confluence with tributaries, at upper end of high water regime.  The muck comes from decayed leaves of stream bottom hard- woods and, less often, cypress.  Confined chiefly to a limited range along the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama, one-toed amphiumas are known in Georgia only from the Ochlockonee River drainage in Thomas and Grady counties.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aOTAMx", "ELCode": "AAAAB01020", "scientific_name": "Amphiuma pholeter", "ITIS_TSN": "173611", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103402", "common_name": "One-toed Amphiuma"}}
