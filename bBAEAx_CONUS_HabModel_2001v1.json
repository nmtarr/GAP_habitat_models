A field guide to the nests, eggs and nestlings of North American birds. Collins, Cleveland, Ohio."}, "habitat_description": "Bald Eagles occupy areas of mature forest surrounding aquatic habitats such as coasts, bays, rivers, and lakes although they sometimes travel long distances from water.  Bald eagles prefer areas with horizontal and vertical views and high water-to-land edge (AGFD 2002).    They nest in forests and cliffs along water in areas with high prey availability (i.e. fish, waterfowl, and seabirds; Andrew and Mosher 1982, Green 1985, Campbell et al. 1990), and may be found in the arid western U.S. (Buehler 2000). Most nest in live or dead pine trees (Collopy 1987) but also use cypress, deciduous hardwoods, and mangrove trees (Layne et al. 1977, Kayle 1978, Buehler 2000), and they may nest on the ground in treeless areas (Buehler 2000).  Nests can weigh more than 100 lbs and thus are usually in mature trees (Brown and Amadon 1968).  Normally it is the largest tree, taller than the surrounding stand, providing an easy flight path and open view of the nesting area (Palmer 1988, Johnsgard 1990).   Location of the nest is rarely in deep woods, but is rather along the edge of the forest stand. (Hamel 1992, Palmer 1988).\r\n\r\nBald eagles forage near and over salt and freshwater estuaries, lakes, open marshes, and shorelines (Hamel 1992).  Like the nest tree, roosting and perching trees are among the tallest in the stand (Palmer 1988).  Bald eagle usually have 4 types of perches; 1) Guard Perch- tall trees, cliff and ridge tops and cliff faces, 2) Foraging Perch- adjacent to or overhanging river or lake, 3) Shade Perch, 4) Roost Perch- resting at night, in good view of nest (AGFD 2002).  Sheltered valleys, forested bottomlands, and coniferous trees provide communal roost sites (AGFD 2002).   Along the Columbia River, mature conifer and old-growth forests were selected during low and high tides and bottomland broadleaf trees on river islands were used for hunting perches. High use areas were shoreline habitat with large perch trees that offered an unobstructed view of foraging areas. Tree structure was more important than tree species (Garret et. al. 1993).  Wood (1992) found that marsh, water, and hardwoods habitats were used in proportion to availability in Florida.  Cypress was significantly utilized because of its location along most lake edges (Wood & Collopy 1991).  The top three preferred habitats for perching, flying, and soaring were cypress swamps (19.8%), pinewoods (19.2%), and hardwoods (15.7%). Other commonly used habitats were marshes (14.0%), lakes (11.9%), pastures with trees (9.8%), and pastures/clearcuts (4.0/3.6%) (Wood 1992).  \r\n\r\nThe winter distribution of Bald Eagles is defined by food availability, presence of roost sites that provide protection from inclement weather, and absence of human disturbance (Buehler 2000).  Wintering birds require adequate food supplies such as those usually found in river rapids, impoundments, dam spillways, lakes, and estuaries (AGFD 2002).  They may occur in semideserts and grasslands, especially near prairie dog towns (Andrews and Righter, 1992).  \r\n\r\nNests are commonly in areas within 4km of bodies of water (Andrew and Mosher 1982, Green 1985, Campbell et al. 1990).   Average nest distance to water was 576 m in north Florida and 1.48 km in central Florida.  Most nests are within 3 km of open water greater than 10 ha in size (Collopy 1987; Buehler [2000] reported 2 km).   \r\n\r\nBald Eagles avoid areas with nearby human activity (boat traffic, pedestrians) and development (Buehler et al. 1991).  They show an aversion to nesting within 100 m of human structures but nests are on average > 500 m from structures (Buehler 2000).  \r\n\r\nStinson et al. (2001) found that in Washington State Bald Eagles foraged over water at an average distance of 500 m from the shore (Buehler 2000).  Distances between roost sites and foraging habitat can be great: 29km in Utah, > 10 km in other western states, but < 1 km in NC and VA.  VA roosts in large blocks of forest (Buehler 2000).\r\n\r\nHome range size of resident pairs averaged 22 square km for breeding and nonbreeding periods with a range of 6-47 square km. Core areas averaged 0.1-1.0 square km (Garret et. al. 1993).  \r\n\r\nDuring winter, Bald Eagles typically stay in areas below 500 m in elevation but may reach heights of 2500 m in western states (Beuhler 2000).\r\n\r\nIn Arizona, not an uncommon resident at lakes and streams of the White Mountain region and rarer west to Salt River and Flagstaff; transient in northern mountains and Kaibab Plateau (Phillips et al. 1964).  Winter records in Arizona are mainly from Flagstaff and Colorado River regions; they are rare in the southeast (Phillips et al. 1964).  In Nevada, bald eagles are a winter visitant (Alcorn 1988).  In Colorado, population numbers increase in winter, often seen on plains, western river systems, and mountain parks (Kingery 1998).  They scavenge along reservoir shores and rivers, for fish or crippled waterfowl; may steal fish from Osprey or prairie dogs from Ferruginous hawks (Kingery 1998).  They are uncommon to locally common winter resident in western valleys, in mountain parks, and eastern plains (Andrews and Righter 1992).  N.
