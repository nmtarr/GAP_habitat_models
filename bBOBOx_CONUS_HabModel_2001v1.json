Trends indicate that populations are declining since the 1900\u2019s (NatureServe 2009).  The primary threats to this species are loss of habitat and early haying of fields used for nesting (NatureServe 2009).  \r\n\r\nBobolinks traditionally bred in tall- or mixed-grass prairies (Martin and Gavin 1995).  Today, they are found in tall, grassy habitats with broad-leaved forbs that are moist and lush, and they avoid dryer areas (Martin and Gavin 1995, NatureServe 2009).  Bobolinks prefer habitat with moderate to tall vegetation, moderate to dense vegetation, moderately deep litter, and little woody vegetation (NatureServe 2009).  Breeding habitat includes upland and wet native prairies, wet meadows, weedy meadows near wetlands, grassy meadows, grass-sedge fields along river bottomlands, herbaceous wetlands, open grasslands, meadows, grassy marshlands, emergent wetlands, mixed grasslands, weedy meadows, tall grass prairie, and bluegrass/quackgrass communities (Martin and Gavin 1995, NatureServe 2009).  Skutch (1996) reported that they avoid marshes.  Cultivated areas are also used and include: hayfields, lightly to moderately grazed pastures, no-till cropland, small-grain fields, old fields, planted cover, irrigated hayfields, cropland-hedgerows, cultivated clovers and grain, deep cultivated grains and hayfields, planted cover, cool-season grasses, alfalfa grass hayfields, wet pastures, oldfields, domestic haylands, wheat, and wet-meadow pasture  (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] fields, Permanent Cover Program [PCP] fields, and Dense Nesting Cover [DNC]) (Martin and Gavin 1995, Jaramillo and Burke 1999, AGFD 2002, Andrews and Righter 1992, NatureServe 2009).  \r\n\r\nIn Colorado, Bobolinks are a local summer resident and migrant, mostly in northern Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992).  In Colorado, species breeds in moist tallgrass meadows and hayfields (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Across the western US, Bobolinks seem to select hayfields in moist areas, but in Colorado, the species seems to select irrigated hayfields (Kingery 1998).  Fifteen of the 21 Atlas reports found the birds in hayfields (Kingery 1998).  Other Atlas reports found the birds in emergent wetlands and mixed grassland (Kingery 1998).  In New Mexico, almost entirely accidental occurrences or wandering individuals (Ligon 1961).  \r\n\r\nAlthough this species generally breeds in grassy meadows and irrigated hayfields, they require additional habitat features that limit their distribution (Kingery 1998).  Nest sites must be in fairly wet but not marshy fields and usually require forbs nearby as well as perches for territorial males (Kingery 1998).  They nest in a depression on the ground among tall grasses, sing from elevated perches such as weeds, telephone wires, or treetops and forage on the ground for insects and seeds (Skutch 1996).  Bobolinks seem to prefer old hayfields (at least 8 years old) that have a high litter cover (Kingery 1998).\r\n\r\nThis species is generally found below 2100m in elevation (Andrews and Righter 1992). In Arizona, bobolink can be found from 1475-2140m (AGFD 2002).  \r\n\r\nBobolinks are sensitive to the size of habitat patches and to edge effects.  Kobal et al. (1999) found bobolinks occurred in grasslands of >25 ha.  Herkert (1994) recommended that grasslands should be >50 ha to be considered source habitat for Boblinks.  Grasslands that were = 10 ha had less than half the abundance of calling male Boblinks than fields of = 30 ha (Bollinger and Gavin 1992).  In Nebraska, the minimum patch size requirement for wet meadows was greater than 40 hectares, and abundance was lower near woody edges (less than 100 m) than far (greater than 100 m) from woody edges (NatureServe 2009).  Bollinger and Gavin (2004) found that Bobolink nest success was significantly lower within grassland 50m from a forested edge.  Fletcher et. Al (2002) found that bobolink density was lower along woodland edges.  In the eastern and midwestern US, management recommendations are to create large habitat patches (greater then 10-30 hectares) and minimize woody edges whenever possible (NatureServe 2009).  Jones and Vickery (1997) recommend a minimum area of 2-4 hectares (Jones and Vickery 1997).\r\n\r\nDuring migration and winter, Bobolinks can be found in grasslands, croplands, freshwater marshes, and wild rice fields, and open woody areas (Andrews and Righter 1992, Martin and Gavin 1995, AGFD 2002).
