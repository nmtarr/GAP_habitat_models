Where there are no cattails in Arizona, it will nest in willows, mesquite, or elderberry trees (Phillips et al. 1978). \r\n\r\nIn marshes, nests are built near or over water (Ehrlich et al. 1988) in clumps of cattail (Typha), bulrush (Scirpus), sedge (Carex), reed (Phragmites), bur reed (Sparganium), emergent wetland vegetation, willow (Salix), sedges, shrubs, or small trees (Orians 1980, Yasukawa and Searcy 1995).  In upland habitats, nests are placed in sturdy herbaceous plants such as willow and alder (Alnus) trees, buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), goldenrod (Solidago), blackberry (Rubus), fleabane (Erigeron), wheat, barley (Hordeum vulgare), alfalfa, and rice or occasionally on the ground (Yasukawa and Searcy 1995, Nicholson 1997).\r\n\r\nRed-winged Blackbirds forage in habitats such as marsh, pasture, prairie, old fields, cropland, lakeshores, and feed lots (Yasukawa and Searcy 1995).  At the beginning of the breeding season, males forage primarily in upland meadows and farmlands but once the females arrive on the breeding grounds, males spend more of their time foraging at wetland breeding sites (Skutch 1996).  In marshes, males display on emergent vegetation and glean insects from it (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Skutch 1996).  Breeding birds roost in habitats with dense cover (Yasukawa and Searcy 1995).\r\n\r\nIn the centennial mountains of Idaho, this species can be found in the summer at elevations ranging from 1860-1940 m, with major vegetation including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willows (Douglas et al. 1992).  Will remain in shallower part of Typha marshes when found with Yellow-headed Blackbird, which inhabits the deeper part of the marsh (Orians 1980).  It is a common resident in valley marshlands and meadows of Utah, where it nests.  In winter, large flocks remain in the warmer valleys (Hayward et al. 1976).\r\n\r\nRed-winged Blackbirds occur in large flocks during migration and winter in grain producing agricultural areas.  These flocks roost in dense cover in wetland habitats, rice paddies, deciduous thickets, coniferous stands, canebrakes, and sugarcane (Saacharum officinarum) fields (Yasukawa and Searcy 1995).  \r\n\r\nN.
