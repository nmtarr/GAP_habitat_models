Haxton and Berrill (1999) reported that hibernation occurred exclusively in bogs in central Ontario and in sphagnum swamps on an island in Georgian Bay, Ontario (Litzgus and Brooks 2000). Eggs are laid in well-drained soil of marshy pastures, in grass or sedge tussock or mossy hummocks, in open areas (e.g., dirt path or road) at edge of thick vegetation, or similar sites exposed to sun. Sandy, sparsely vegetated strips and washouts along agricultural field edges are favorable for nesting (Litzgus and Mousseau 2004).\r\n\r\nIn general, habitats occupied by the spotted turtle include unpolluted, shallow bodies of water with a soft bottom and aquatic vegetation, such as small marshes, marshy pastures, bogs, fens, woodland streams, swamps, small ponds, vernal pools, and lake margins; in some areas they occur in brackish tidal streams. Ponds bordered by relatively undisturbed meadow or undergrowth are most favorable. Spotted turtles favor waters with a soft bottom and aquatic vegetation and often bask along the water's edge, on brush piles in water, or on logs or vegetation clumps. Moving seasonally among different wetland types and may spend substantial time on land during summer (DeGraaf and Rudis 1983).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSPTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAD02010", "scientific_name": "Clemmys guttata", "ITIS_TSN": "173771", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100580", "common_name": "Spotted Turtle"}}
