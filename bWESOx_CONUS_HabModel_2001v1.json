In the inland northwest, the species is not found in douglas-fir or lodgepole pine forests (Hayward and Garton, 1988). While some authors suspect use of ponderosa pine woodlands (Cannings and Angell, 2001; Cannings, 2004), the species has only been documented with ponderosa where it is either scattered among oak woodland or on the immediate edge of oak woodland (Marshall, 1957, Wise-Gervais, 2005).\r\n\r\nNests and roosts are located in tree cavities, saguaro cavities, and, occasionally, in dense thickets (Hardy et al., 1999; Cannings, 2004).\r\n\r\nM. kennicottii has been documented at elevations from near sea level in the coastal states and Arizona (Bowles, 1917; Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Wise-Gervais, 2005), up to ~2400 m in both Arizona and Wyoming (Fitton, 1993; Wise-Gervais, 2005).\r\n\r\nRadio-tracking by Hayward and Garton (1988) in the mountains of central Idaho, indicated that the species remains close to water, and their mapping of home ranges were confined to within 240 m of streams.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bWESOx", "ELCode": "ABNSB01040", "scientific_name": "Megascops kennicottii", "ITIS_TSN": "686659", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103456", "common_name": "Western Screech-owl"}}
