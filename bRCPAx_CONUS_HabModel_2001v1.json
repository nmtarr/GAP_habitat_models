Several populations exist throughout southern and central Texas including Brownsville, Harlingen, McAllen, Mission, San Antonio and San Marcos. In Florida, breeding populations are established in Orange, Broward and Dade counties including the cities of Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, and Miami as well as Key Largo in the northern Florida Keys. In southern California, the species is resident to Los Angeles and Orange counties and south to San Diego. Small numbers have been recorded on the Monterey Peninsula (Roberson and Tenney 1993) and in San Francisco and Sacramento but breeding has not been confirmed (Froke 1981, Am. Ornithol. Union 1983, Lever 1987, Forshaw 1989, Collar et al. 1992, Roberson and Tenney 1993, Small 1994, Garrett 1996).\r\nIn the U.S., the red-crowned parrot is typically established in cities and urban areas, and prefers areas with large trees (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997). Habitat may also include lowland deciduous forest and pine-oak woodlands; this species will also forage in cultivated areas (NatureServe 2009). Typical native habitat includes Tamaulipan scrub, especially in ravines or riparian areas with larger trees, and dry oak-sweet gum forests. Native habitat is generally described as sub-deciduous tropical forest (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bRCPAx", "ELCode": "ABNQA15080", "scientific_name": "Amazona viridigenalis", "ITIS_TSN": "177806", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102063", "common_name": "Red-crowned Parrot"}}
