It shows a strong association with open canopy mature deciduous mixed woodlots but is apparently indifferent to undergrowth density (Gardali & Ballard 2000).  Cottonwood and poplar (Populus spp.) riparian communities are used throughout the range (Gardali & Ballard 2000).\r\nWarbling Vireos occur where a river, stream, pond, or large lake is lined by hardwoods (Hamel 1992, Turcotte & Watts 1999) such as willow, alder (Farrand 1983), sycamore, and balm-of-Gilead (Simpson 1992), but also  occur in upland areas, such as aspen groves, orchards, farm fencerows, campgrounds, regenerating deciduous clear cuts, well wooded residential or park areas.  In addition, this species will also utilize human landscapes such as parks, gardens, orchards, farm fencerows, as well as deciduous patches in pine forests (Johnsgard 1992, Gardali and Ballard 2000).  It will sometimes use single or clumped broadleaved trees (aspen, birches) within coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1992).  In Arkansas, breeding is restricted to cottonwoods and willows in riparian areas (Gardali and Ballard 2000).  In other parts of their range, nests have been found in poplar, maple (Acer sp.), elm (Ulmus sp.), birch (Betula sp.), oak (Quercus sp.), Arizona walnut (Q. arizonica), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), Arizona white oak (Q. arizonica), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), willow (Salix sp.), red alder (Alnus rubra), Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia), California bay (Umbellularra californica), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), black oak (Quercus kelloggii), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), water birch (Betula occidentalis), arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), apple (Malus sp.), pear (Pyrus communis), and pecan (Carya illinoensis; Gardali and Ballard 2000).  Warbling Vireos use forest interiors and edges and are not restricted by patch size (Gardali and Ballard 2000).\r\n\r\nThis species is a common statewide summer resident in mountain ranges in Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  In Colorado, it is most numerous in aspen forests and also occurs in lowland and foothill riparian forests.  They sometimes occur in urban areas with tall trees and are rare in coniferous forests lacking deciduous trees (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998).  In Arizona, they are also partial to aspen groves but will accept other broad-leaved trees, where sufficiently numerous within the coniferous forest (Phillips et al. 1964).\r\n\r\nN.
