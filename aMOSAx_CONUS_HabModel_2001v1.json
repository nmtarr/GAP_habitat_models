They breed in shallow, semi-permanent ponds with abundant vegetation.  Mole salamanders are highly fossorial and live in burrows in or near floodplains or other low-lying areas throughout most of the year (Mount 1975).  Populations often localized around breeding ponds (Shoop 1964).  Populations in the piedmont and mountains usually occur in upland hardwood or mixed pine-hardwood forests near semi-permanent ponds.  The presence of soils with a sand component appears to be important to population distributions due to their fossorial activities.  They breed in winter in the south, and fall in the north.  Larvae are found in ponds and ditches.  Clutches of up to several hundred eggs are laid singly in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, in masses in the Mississippi Valley Physiographic Province (Semlisch & Walls 1990). Adults leave the breeding ponds by mid-May (in March in South Carolina).  Reproductive success is positively correlated with duration of standing water in breeding pond, but not with number of breeding females or number of eggs laid (Semlitsch 1987).  Larvae metamorphose into terrestrial form in late spring or summer, or early fall, or the following spring, or become paedomorphic (Semlitsch 1985).  Facultative paedomorphosis is associated with permanent or nearly permanent ponds. In Louisiana, reproductive cycle is annual (mainly), biennial, or otherwise; first breeding occurs at 2 years (reported as 1 year in South Carolina) (Raymond and Hardy 1990). In South Carolina, reproductive success varied greatly and is poor or minimal during drought periods (Pechmann et al. 1991).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aMOSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01120", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma talpoideum", "ITIS_TSN": "173604", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103509", "common_name": "Mole Salamander"}}
