They mainly occupy wooded areas and appear not to take well to predominantly open habitats, such as farmland, as does the red fox. They are associated with deciduous forests (perhaps preferring early successional stages of forest - Webster et al. 1985), but will use all forest types available to them in areas of mixed forest. They can also be found in lowland swamps and coastal plain hammocks. Like the red fox, gray foxes can be found in partially wooded suburban areas (Webster et al. 1985). In Florida habitats are reported as wooded habitats including swamps, hammocks, pine forests, old fields, and disturbed areas (Layne et al. 1977), open pinelands, flatwoods, palmetto scrub, hammocks, australian pine, but rarely in mangrove zones (Layne 1984). While gray foxes are typically considered a species of dense woods and brush, in the southeast gray fox may be more abundant in mixed woods and cultivated areas. High pine sandhills seem to be a less productive habitat, and home ranges are larger. Xeric oak forest, old fields and pastures, and mesic hardwoods used more than expected, wet prairies and high pine sandhill less than expected (Sunquist 1989). Rosenblatt (1999) found that grey foxes only occurred in forest patches greater than 24 ha. In Putnam county Florida, the mean harmonic home range is 582 ha, ranging between 223 - 1140 ha.  Density is 1/square km. Mean core area is 82 ha. Home range at Savanna River for males was 26 to 62 square km, for females 8 to 14 square km. In forested deciduous habitats of eastern North America, gray foxes prefer a mixture of fields and woods as opposed to large tracts of homogenous forest (Wood et al. 1958, Cypher 2003).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nGray foxes occur in deserts, open forests and brush. Distributed along foothills of eastern slope in southeast Colorado and at lower elevations on western slopes (Fitzgerald et al., 1994). Throughout Arizona, mostly in pinyon-juniper and oak belt or below (Hoffmeister, 1986). Coniferous woodland is the most prevalent woodland, covering nearly 21% of New Mexico (Frey and Yates, 1996). In most areas, these woodlands are dominated by Rocky Mountain pinon pine and one-seed juniper. One of the  mammals characteristic of this biotic zone is gray fox. Gray foxes appear to be tolerant of, and perhaps benefit from, residential development until residential density exceeds a threshold beyond which gray foxes avoid residential areas. The threshold for avoidance of residential areas appear to be between 50 and 125 residents / km2 (50 and 125 residents per 100 ha). Gray foxes can use areas bisected by major roadways if culverts are provided. Preferred habitat includes wooded areas, broken country, brushlands, rocky areas.  Also found in rocky or riparian habitat in open grassland ecozones. Range derived from: Cypher (2003), Hoffmeister (1986), Fitzgerald et al (1994), Hall (1995) and Durrant (1952). Maximum elevation of 2500m from Hall (1995). In California, this species is an uncommon to common resident of shrublands, valley foothill and montane riparian, and brushy deciduous and conifer forest and woodlands and meadows (Ahlborn et al. 2005 [based on Zeiner et al. 1990]).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, gray foxes are common in post oak savanna, cross timbers and the Edwards Plateau regions in edge habitats of both uplands and bottomlands. They prefer woodland borders and small clearings of heterogeneous environments such as those adjacent to cropland and pasture. They frequently use abandoned roads and trails for traveling between habitats especially those with scattered thickets of dense underbrush. Nesting/denning sites are often beside or beneath rocky outcrops, hollow trees, brush piles, and other concealed spaces under dense cover and near water (Schmidly 2004).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\nFritzell and Haroldson (1982) state, \"No carnivore in eastern North America is more closely associated with deciduous forest than the gray fox (Hall 1981). In Wisconsin, gray foxes were most abundant near brush covered bluffs where woodland and farmland were well interspersed (Petersen et al. 1977, Richards and Hine 1953). \u2026 In western North America, gray foxes favored brushy vegetation in association with rugged, broken terrain (Grinnell et al. 1937, Hardy 1945, Johnson et al. 1948, Leopold 1959, Nelson 1930)\". In southern Illinois, Follman (1973) found that early old fields and woodlands were utilized at higher than expected rates while agriculture and brushy habitats much less so (Fritzell and Haroldson 1982).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGRFOx", "ELCode": "AMAJA04010", "scientific_name": "Urocyon cinereoargenteus", "ITIS_TSN": "180609", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104188", "common_name": "Gray Fox"}}
