The rat is found in cities and in buildings, homes and other structures of urban and rural areas. It is particularly numerous at ports and shipyards, where populations may be continually reinforced by immigrants from disembarking ships (Lee et al. 1982). Trani et al. (2007) describe habitat in the SE: \"Although the black rat is considered a commensal rodent, it generally is more common in areas influenced by humans than in areas where it has direct contact with humans. However, black rats will live in the upper stories of buildings and other human habitations, particularly during the cold winter months. The black rat is more arboreal than the Norway rat, often living in trees and vine covered fences; heavily landscaped residential and industrialized areas provide good habitat. It also inhabits riparian zones where it inhabits thick vegetation, grain fields, early stages of oldfield succession, fencerows, and abandoned fields. In areas where it comes into contact with the Norway rat, the latter is dominant, often forcing the former into the attics of buildings.\" The black rat is a better climber than the more dominant Norway rat (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Thus, where both species are present, the black rat typically occupies roofs and upper levels of buildings while the Norway rat typically controls ground and subterranean levels. Tree cavities are also used for shelter and nesting. The rat nests in secluded nooks and crannies of buildings (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). \"This species rarely swims and unlike its close relatives, rarely finds a home in sewers or in aquatic areas. Although it was formerly common in towns and farms of temperate regions, it has been largely driven out by the more aggressive Norway rat as well as killed off by increasing chemical pest control programs. Data have shown that R. rattus can reach elevations up to 250 m above sea level. (Corbet and Southern, 1977; Grzimek, 2003)\"(Gillespie 2004). In Texas, Schmidly (2004) describes habitat: \"Roof rats are largely commensals and live in close association with man. They seldom become established as feral animals as do the Norway rats; however, in Lavaca County they have been found throughout the county, in the towns, and on the farms. They inhabited grocery and drug stores, warehouses, feed stores, and poultry houses and were very common in cotton gins and associated grain warehouses. On the farms they lived in barns and corncribs. They may live near the ground, but usually they frequent the attics, rafters, and crossbeams of the buildings. They make typical runways along pipes, beams or wires, up and down the studding, or along the horizontal ceiling joists, often leaving a dark-colored layer of grease and dirt to mark their travelways. Like the Norway rat, the roof rat is largely nocturnal and only where populations are relatively high does one see them frequently in the daytime. There is some indication that the larger and more aggressive Norway rat is supplanting the roof rat in many parts of the United States. In the southern United States, however, the roof rat is by far the more common of the two.\" In southern portions of its range, the rat may also nest in brushy fields and hedgerows adjacent to farmsteads as well as in arboreal situations, such as in tree cavities and among palm leaves (Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). In Florida they are found in natural and developed areas, buildings, dumps, brush, hammocks, cactus \"jungles\", mangroves, and debris (Layne 1984), freshwater marsh with emergent vegetation, cattails or sawgrass (Barbour and Humphrey 1982), barrier beaches, coastal scrub (Fernald 1989) and sugar cane fields (Lefebvre 1982). May be correlated to decrease in P. gossypinus subspecies decline (Humphrey et al. 1988). Mean home range sizes are 0.20 +/- 0.0015 ha for males and 0.16 +/- 0.040 ha for females (Berger and Negus 1981).\r\n\r\nNorthwest/Southwest:\r\nIn Oregon (and presumably Washington as well), Verts and Carraway (1998) indicate that this species is restricted mostly of port cities and coastal regions associated with human environs such as wharves, piers, docks, and warehouses, although feral populations may inhabit wet coastal forests (Banfield 1974). They were also observed in Sitka spruce and alder adjacent to standing water (Pimentel 1949), on the willow borders of marsh vegetation in Douglas county, and coniferous west slope Cascade forests (Dalquest 1948). In California, Jameson and Peeters (1988) identified foothill blackberry thickets as habitat. This species is also \"Found in buildings, preferring attics, rafters, walls, and enclosed spaces (Godin 1977), and along streamcourses (Ingles 1965). Common in urban habitats. May occur in valley foothill riparian habitat at lower elevations. In northern California, occurs in dense himalayaberry thickets (Dutson 1973)\" [quoted directly from Brylski et al.
