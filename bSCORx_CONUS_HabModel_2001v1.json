Found most commonly in elevated, arid habitats; in particular desert-facing slopes of mountains or semiarid plains between mountain ranges (Flood 2002).  This species is well-adapted to hot, dry environments (Flood 2002).  Is a summer resident of Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992), an uncommon summer resident in Utah (Behle et al. 1985); also summers locally in northern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona (Monson and Phillips 1981, Ligon 1961).  Found in yucca, pinyon-juniper, arid oak scrub and palm oases (Monson and Phillips 1981, Ligon 1961).  Common summer resident in evergreen oaks and yuccas in southeastern and central Arizona, mainly in mountains and foothills, and in beargrass and yucca in southwestern Arizona (Monson and Phillips 1981).  Also breed in the pinyons of northern Arizona (Monson and Phillips 1981).  In Texas, lives in elevated arid country (Oberholser 1974).  Occupies both juniper-oak woods and yucca (Oberholster 1994).  In Nevada is a summer resident in desert scrub and woodland (Alcorn 1988).  Casual straggler or transient in the lower Colorado River valley (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In New Mexico, is common on and adjacent to the foothills (Ligon 1961).  Nest in yucca \"forests\" (Ligon 1961).  In Colorado, is a local summer resident along the western border of the state (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Will breed in pinyon-juniper or juniper groves in semi-desert shrublands (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Uncommon summer resident in Utah usually in juniper forests or associated shrubbery; in southwestern Utah occurs in Joshua tree-cholla cactus-creosote bush association (Behle et al. 1985).\r\nIn California, found mainly in Lower and Upper Sonoran Life Zones, from about 300 (in southern deserts) to 2,500 m (in White Mtns.). Typically breeds in low-elevation desert oases, in yucca, pi\u00f1on-juniper, and Joshua tree woodlands in higher-elevation desert plateaus, and on arid, desert-facing slopes of southern mountains and desert mountain ranges. Also, but less commonly, in adjacent dry interior oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands (Garrett and Dunn 1981, Small 1994). In Joshua Tree National Monument, almost always found in pi\u00f1on pine and Joshua tree woodlands, or in canyons where smaller tree yuccas (e.g., Yucca mohavensis) are found; only rarely in open flats (Miller and Stebbins 1964). In Deep Canyon, CA, most nests found in pi\u00f1on-juniper and lower plateau habitats, but a few pairs nest on alluvial plain and in chaparral (Weathers 1983). In Arizona, closely associated with yucca trees, and thus found in habitats where these are common, such as the live-oak belt of foothills and higher grasslands; smaller numbers breed in pi\u00f1on-pine habitats of n. Arizona and in beargrass and yucca associations in sw. Arizona; tends to avoid Lower Sonoran Zone, nesting in tall yuccas in surrounding mountains (Brandt 1951, Phillips et al. 1964, Jaramillo and Burke 1999)(quoted directly from Flood 2002).\r\nIn New Mexico, found where tall yucca trees are most common, on and adjacent to desert foothills and mountains (Lignon 1961). In Los Alamos Co., nests from lowland tree yucca grasslands up into pi\u00f1on-juniper and oak woodlands (Travis 1992). In a study of a Chihuahuan Desert habitat in s.-central New Mexico, Scott\u2019s Oriole nested almost exclusively in upland habitat, where its preferred nest trees, Torrey (Y. torreyi) and soaptree yuccas (Y. elata), were more common, rather than in adjacent arroyo habitat (Kozma and Mathews 1997)(quoted directly from Flood 2002).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Brewster Co., TX, occurs from Rio Grande (about 600 m) to near top of Mt. Emory (approx. 1,600 m; Oberholser 1974); ranges widely in Black Gap Wildlife Management Area, Brewster Co., but particularly common on hillsides (650\u2013800 m elevation) where lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla) and yucca are abundant (Thompson 1953)(quoted directly from Flood 2002).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Wyoming, restricted to Utah juniper communities (Fitton and Scott 1984). In Colorado, found below 1,700 m in areas of pi\u00f1on-juniper and desert scrub, particularly groves of sparse juniper interspersed with yuccas (Dexter 1998)(quoted directly from Flood 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bSCORx", "ELCode": "ABPBXB9200", "scientific_name": "Icterus parisorum", "ITIS_TSN": "179082", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100446", "common_name": "Scott's Oriole"}}
