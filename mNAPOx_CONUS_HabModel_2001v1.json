It primarily associated with forests and woodlands, but exists in a wide variety of vegetative communities in a variety of climates, including forests, rangelands, open tundra, deserts, Yellow pine forests, often close to riparian areas and brushy stream bottomlands (Zeveloff 1988).  Historical records of a large population in the second quarter of the 1900\u2019s exist, but the species is now rare is places like Arizona and the Great Basin (Brown and Babb 2009).  While porcupines inhabit the Great Basin, their populations there have been dynamic in recent decades. For example, in the Granite Basin of Nevada, porcupine experienced a steep population decline that was likely the result of Mountain Lion depredation.  They are now rare in some riparian areas that once supported dense populations of porcupines (Sweitzer et al. 1997).  Porcupine sightings have diminished significantly since 2000 in Arizona, likely as a result of predation from Mountain Lions.  However, all of Arizona\u2019s national forests and Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge had sightings between 2000 and 2008.  They were reportedly very abundant in the subalpine conifer forests of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon (Brown and Babb 2009).  They have recently expanded their range into the the pinyon-juniper woodlands of the Edwards Plateau in Texas (Ilse and Hellgren 2001).  \r\n\r\nHabitat use by the porcupine is related to feeding, avoiding predators and to a lesser degree, resting (Griesmer et al. 1998). The species uses dens such as rock caves, cavities in trees, and hollow logs for resting during winter (Griesmer et al. 1998). Favored habitat is one where piles of large stones, talus, or rocks with crevices afford shelter in or near timber (Hall 1995).  In deserts, plains, and tundra, porcupines inhabit riparian areas (Zeveloff 1998, Sweitzer 2003). In arid locations, they inhabit riparian areas during winter.  In summer, they forage in meadows, shrubby areas, and riparian communities (Timossi 1995).\r\n\r\nPorcupines occur throughout New Mexico (Frey 2004) where they are mostly associated with conifers in montane and subalpine forests and pinyon-juniper woodlands (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). In addition, they occupy cottonwood-willow forests in river bottoms, aspen groves, and semidesert shrublands (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Young forests may be preferred to mature ones, and ridges with short trees that stay snow free for long periods of time may be preferred habitat (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  In New Mexico they favor northern aspects (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Linear daily movements ranged from 111 to 129m during the summer, and home ranges averaged 14ha (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The mean home range during winter is 5ha (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). The elevation range is from 0-3,230 m (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992, Hall 1995).\r\n\r\nPorcupines occur throughout Colorado but are most common in the forested mountainous portions, especially in areas with coniferous trees (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is not unusual to find an individual in sagebrush flats or even open prairie on the eastern plains (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is most common in evergreen forests (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992). However, in this area, it is found almost anywhere there are trees, from sea level to above timberline (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992).  \r\n\r\nAlthough the porcupine is usually associated with forests or woodlands, it does occur in Arizona in grassland, chaparral, low elevation riparian vegetation or desert scrub (Hoffmeister 1986).  Surveys of wildlife biologists by Brown and Babb (2009) indicated that is uses Subalpine Conifer forest and associated meadows, Rocky Mountain Montane Conifer Forest and Meadow, Plains and Great Basin Grasslands, Great Basin Conifer Woodland, Semidesert Grassland, urban, and suburban areas.  They did not receive evidence of porcupines in Rocky Mountain Alpine Tundra, Interior Chaparral, and Desertscrub.\r\n\r\nThe porcupine is common throughout Utah (UDWR 2003), where it prefers coniferous forest and mixed forest area although it may be found in riparian zones, desert and shrubland habitats (UDWR, 2003).  \r\n\r\nIn California, porcupines are most common in montane conifer, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziessi), alpine dwarf-shrub, and wet meadow habitats.  They are less common in hardwood, hardwood-conifer, riparian, aspen, pinyon-juniper, low sage, sagebrush, and bitterbrush.  They occupy regenerating redwood and Douglas-fir forests in northwestern California.  Feed on ocotillo in deserts, orchards, and other crops, and trees such as yellow pine, Douglas-fir, pinyon pine, lodgepole pine, western white pine, limber pine, bristlecone pine, firs, oaks, maples, willows, and elderberry (Timossi 1995). \r\n\r\nIn Oregon, they feed on ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, western hemlock, Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, western redcedar, lodgepole pine, western white pine, elderberry, willow, and maple (Timossi 1995).\r\n\r\n In New York, they feed on hemlock, red spruce, sugar maple, yellow birch, striped maple, beech, and balsam fir (Timossi 1995).\r\n\r\nIn Texas, they are most common in forested areas but also found in flats, valleys, and gulches.  They prefer rocky areas, ridges, and slopes (Schmidely 1994).\r\n\r\nIn Oregon, porcupines have been documented in lava fields with buckbrush and Manzanita, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, mixed-conifer (Verts and Carraway 1998).\r\n\r\nPorcupines have been found statewide in Nevada (Hall 1995).  In the Granite Range, Sweitzer (2003) found porcupines to center their activity around riparian vegetative communities associated with springs.  They also denned in rock outcrops and juniper shrublands during the early summer.  N.
