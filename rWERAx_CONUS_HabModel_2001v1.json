The elevational range has been estimated from sea level up to 3355 meters, while most populations are reported to occur below 2745 meters (Basey 1976; Campbell and Lamar 2004; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nThis snake is described as primarily terrestrial, but also climbs trees and shrubs. Periods of inactivity are spent in mammal burrows, caves, crevices, and other similar sites. In general terms, the habitats occupied by this species include bare rock, talus, scree, forest edge, forest woodland, grassland, savanna, shrubland, chaparral, conifer woodland, and hardwood woodland (Natureserve.org). Well established populations are also found in shrubby coastal dunes, timberline, shrubby basins, canyons, and open mountain forests (Brown et al. 1995; Campbell and Lamar 2004; Hammerson 1999; Lowe et al. 1986; Nussbaum et al. 1983; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nNW\t - Forest/woodland, forest edge, conifer woodland, hardwood woodland, open mountain forests.\r\nSW\t - Shrubby coastal dunes, shrubby basins, canyons, grassland and herbaceous woodlands, savanna, shrubland and chaparral.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWERAx", "ELCode": "ARADE02140", "scientific_name": "Crotalus oreganus", "ITIS_TSN": "209548", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104250", "common_name": "Western Rattlesnake"}}
