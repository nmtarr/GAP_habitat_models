They inhabit fast-flowing clear, unpolluted streams with cascades, riffles, and waterfalls (Willson and Kingery 2011).  Larger and deeper streams, estuaries, ponds, and lakes are used during winter in addition to habitat suitable for breeding (Willson and Kingery 2011).  Breeding sites are usually along streams that are < 15 m wide or 2 m deep, and they prefer bottoms with rocks, sand, large rocks, and boulders. They nest in adjacent cliffs, rocks, and stream banks (Kingery 1998).  They are not good with frozen waters (Kingery 1996).  They are primarily found in vicinity of coniferous forests but suitable streams can occur within deciduous forest, prairie, sagebrush, urban areas; riparian vegetation type is not an important component of habitat suitability (DeGraaf et al. 1991, Willson and Kingery 2011).
