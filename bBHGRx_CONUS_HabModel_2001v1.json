It needs to be near water and is associated with riparian habitats in many regions, such as areas of California that are dominated by dry chaparral, grassland, or desert (Ortega and Hill 2010).  \r\n\r\nReported breeding habitats include yards and gardens if there is adequate cover for nesting (Ortega and Hill 2010); woodland habitats dominated by stands of salt-cedar and Russian olive (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004); ponderosa pine, aspen, foothill riparian forest, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and scrub oak shrublands in Colorado (Kingery 1998); deciduous woodlands; riparian and floodplain habitats of cottonwood (Populus) and willow (Salix); oak savanna; openings in mature pine (Pinus) forests; urban and suburban areas with dense vegetation; tamarisk (Tamarix) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) dominated riparian forest stands; and orchards (Ortega and Hill 2010).\r\n\r\nThey are not typically found in dry chaparral, grassland, or desert away from riparian habitat, or in dense coniferous forests away from clearings (Ortega and Hill 2010).  They are known to breed in both New Mexico and Colorado and will frequently hybridize with the rose-breasted grosbeak, making it difficult to determine exact range (Johnsgard 1979).  They are summer residents throughout the forested mountains of New Mexico and Arizona (Ligon 1961, Monson and Phillips 1981).  Summer resident in the Sandia mountains of New Mexico (Tatschl 1961).  In New Mexico, the grosbeak is typically found in the Upper Sonoran oak, juniper, and nut pine region, and in thick cottonwood groves and deciduous trees and bushes along streams (Bent 1968).  Areas of cattail and rush are known to be utilized due to the presence of caterpillars, used to feed the young (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004).  They nest in Gambel's oak in southwestern Colorado, and nests that are better concealed in high density trees or shrubs have higher success rates (Ortega and Ortega 2003).  They are found in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998).  Found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona (Franzreb and Ohmart 1978).  In Utah, they primarily live in deciduous woodlands of the mountains and streamsides of the valleys, and it is frequently found in ornamentals of towns and parks (Hayward et al. 1976). They are common in Nevada in shrubby vegetation bordering streams in the mountains; sometimes occurs in mountain mahogany (Alcorn 1988).  In southern California, it is restricted to montane pine-oak forests (Ortega and Hill 2010).\r\n\r\nReported elevation ranges are between 1678 and 3049 m in New Mexico, and in Colorado from 1,524 to 2,439 m in Colorado.  It will, however, venture higher or lower if suitable habitat exists (Ligon 1961, Kingery 1998).  N.
