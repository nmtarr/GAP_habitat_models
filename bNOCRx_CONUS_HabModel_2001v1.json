The species nests in a broad range of habitats, including: forests (Campbell et al., 1997; Robinette and Crockett, 1999; Robinette and Ha, 2002); shrub-covered, maritime headlands (Campbell et al., 1997); meadows (Verbeek, 1998); hedgerows (Moul and Elliott, 1994); estuaries (Campbell et al., 1997); residential areas (Robinette and Crockett, 1999; Verbeek and Butler, 1999; Robinette and Ha, 2002); and at landfills (Verbeek and Butler, 1999).
