They prefer cool, moist forested habitats having thick layers of leaf litter for burrowing (Godin 1977), but they also occupy coniferous, deciduous, and mixed woodlands and forests; swamps and bogs; talus slopes; grassy swales; grassy slopes; and old fields (Jones Jr. and Birney 1988, NatureServe 2014).  While they are more abundant in moist environments (Brannon et al. 2010) and their distributions are heavily influenced by moisture and varies at a micro habitat scale, they do occupy xeric upland forests (Greenberg and Miller 2004).  They do not inhabit coastal marshes (Owens 1984).\r\n\r\nMicrohabitat requirements include friable soil, fallen logs/ debris, or standing snag/hollow trees (NatureServe 2014).  They seem to prefer mixed stands of hemlock and deciduous hardwoods (Brown 1997), and they seek shelter in thick leaf litter or humus, moss-covered rock talus and decaying logs and stumps (Webster et al. 1985).  \r\n\r\nCanopy cover and structure do not appear to limit Smoky Shrew distributions.  Greenberg and Miller (2004) compared Smoky Shrew abundance between closed canopy stands, treefall gaps, and salvage harvested treefall gaps in xeric upland forest at Bent Creek, NC and failed to find a difference.  Ford et al. (2002) did not find differences in Smoky Shrew abundance between northern hardwood stands of different ages, including clearcuts and forests >60 years old.\r\n\r\nWithin the region, this shrew appears to be most plentiful at mid and high elevations (Linzey and Linzey 1971, Brannon et al. 2010).  Reported minimum elevations are 300 m (Owens 1984), 670 m (Greenberg and Miller 2004), 448 m (Brannon et al. 2010), and 244 m (Sipe and Browne 2004).  Brannon (2002) found Smoky Shrews to be more abundant on north- than south-facing slopes, although they were present in both environments.\r\n \r\nBreeding season lasts from March to August and gestation is 3 weeks.  Litter size is 2-8 (average 5) with up to 3 litters produced each year.  Unlike many shrews, this one reaches sexual maturity after its first winter.  \r\n\r\nStacy Smith, 12June05 & N.
