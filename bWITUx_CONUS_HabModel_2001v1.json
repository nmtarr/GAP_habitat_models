Its current range represents a mixture of areas where it has been introduced, reintroduced, and persisted throughout time periods when heavy hunting pressure extirpated it from some regions (Eaton 1992).  Six subspecies of Wild Turkey exist.  This habitat description corresponds to the species as a whole, but separate models exist for two subspecies: Merriam\u2019s Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo merriami) and Mexican (Gould\u2019s) Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo mexicana).\r\n\r\nTurkeys inhabit landscapes that provide a variety of microhabitats.  They require complexes of habitat types that provide treed areas for roosting and cover, low, dense growth for nesting, mature, mast-producing trees, and open, herbaceous areas (Porter 1992).  This set of requirements causes them to benefit from forested landscapes that are fragmented by openings such as those created through agricultural practices.  However, arid western landscapes can also fulfill their habitat needs. \r\n\r\nTurkeys prefer open, mature, and park-like forests and savannas and do not like forests with dense undergrowth, except in small areas that they can use for cover and nesting (Hurst 1981).  Scattered openings within forests are used (eg. pastures), and they sometimes occur in suburban environments (Porter 1992).  It was once believed that turkeys required a high proportion of forest in the landscape but range expansions into grass-dominated landscapes (with scattered trees), such as tallgrass prairies and agricultural lands with anthropogenic water sources, have indicated otherwise (Porter 1992).\r\nIn places where hunting/predation risk is low, they will use more open areas than they will where predation risk is high (Williams Jr. 1992).  The broader distribution of Turkeys is limited by persistent deep snow (>10 in), marsh habitats, and dry conditions that preclude the growth of trees (Porter 1992).  They are seldom found in areas with less than 20 to 30 inches of annual rainfall (Eaton 1992). \r\n\r\nTurkeys place nests in areas of dense low vegetation (Porter 1992, Nicholson 1997), often at the base of a tree, under a log, or in a bush (Harrison 1975).  Forested nest sites usually have an open overstory, such as forest edges, power line right-of-ways, or roadside (Porter 1992).  Turkeys rarely nest in trees (Fletcher 1994). \r\n\r\nHens take broods to locations that provide insects for food, are near thermal and predator cover, and that have complete herbaceous ground cover (usually grasses and forbs) short enough to allow parents to scan for predators but tall and sparse enough to allow poults to move and hide within it (approximately < 70 cm tall; Porter 1992).  Brood habitat always includes a mix of herbaceous vegetation and trees (Porter 1992, Wunz and Pack 1992).  These conditions are found in places such as field edges, savannas, forests with grassy understories, riparian woodlands, grassy openings in mixed conifer forests, meadows, aspen glens, and alfalfa fields (Porter 1992).  Broods will venture long distances (>300 m) from trees but always remain near (within 100 m) some type of vegetated cover (e.g., shrubs or tall crops; Porter 1992, Williams Jr. 1992).  \r\n\r\nTurkeys\u2019 habitat use shifts from grasslands toward forests that provide shelter and mast for the fall and winter.  The two key components of winter habitat are food and roosting cover (Porter 1992).  Suitable forests can be hardwood or softwood, as long as they provide mast (pine seeds, acorns, nuts) and are interspersed with fields and edges (Porter 1992).  Their value depends on the age of the trees (the older the better) and the proportion of mast-producing species (Porter 1992).  Natural mast availability is often variable across years, so agricultural residue, such as corn or chufa that is more consistently available, can be important for survival of the winter (Porter 1992).  Turkeys roost in tall trees and, sometimes, large shrubs (Kaufman 1996).  They will roost in trees, such as cypresses, above water (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).\r\n\r\nIn the Southern Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, most Wild Turkey populations are associated with forests, but optimal landscapes for Turkeys are fragmented with a mix of plantations, farms, and clearings.  They are most common in bottomland or wet forests as well as hardwood and mixed forests containing oak species, and less commonly found in pine forests (Hamel 1992, Anderson et al 1981).  They seem to prefer fields or semi-openings where grasses, ferns, or goldenrods are high enough to provide cover, and ideally these openings would be near water (Anderson et al. 1981).  Forest openings, fields, clearings, and pastures with lush grass-forb plant communities are important habitat features (Hurst 1981).  The required ratio of openings to forest has varied amongst studies from 2 to 30% (Hurst 1981).   Most observations of broods in the 1960\u2019s were at fields 10-20 acres in size and those >3 acres were found to be more desirable than those < 3 acres (Hurst 1981).  Some believe that patches of forests 100-200 acres are required by Wild Turkeys (Hurst 1981).  Forest types that are commonly used in the Coastal Plains include, longleaf pine (Pinus australis) forests, turkey oak (Quercus laevis), slash pine (Pinus caribaea) flatwoods, bottomland hardwood forests containing bald cypress (Taxodium disticum), carolina ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), oak, gum, and tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), forests of oak, Nyssa, and bald cypress along tributaries of the Mississippi (Eaton 1992), loblolly-shortleaf pine, oak-pine, longleaf-slash pine, Magnolia grandiflora, and beech (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  Young forests, including pine plantations 2-4 years old, are suitable nest sites, but plantations over 4 years old are not unless they are thinned in some manner (Hurst 1981).  Assessments of the value of pine plantations to wintering turkeys at different times of the year have produced conflicting results, but they do use them in some locations, notably for roosting (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  Hurst and Dickinson (1992) suggest that pine plantations need to be <40 ha and adjacent to early-successional habitat < 5 years old to be suitable for nesting and brood range.  High densities of turkeys occur in longleaf-slash pine forests and bottomland hardwoods along the Mississippi River (Hurst 1981).   Areas along rivers and swamps of cypress and tupelo in Coastal Plain and Piedmont are preferred (Eaton 1992), but water is not a limiting factor in turkey distributions (Hurst 1981).\r\n\r\nSoutheastern Turkeys place nests in woodland margins, old fields, cut-over areas, open woodlands, pine plantations, hayfields, and brush clumps in open forests, generally near a forest edge (Hurst 1981, Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  Broods feed in open grassy areas such as old fields, hayfields, pasture, power line right-of-ways, and grassy forest opening as well as mature bottomland hardwood forests (Hurst 1981, Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  The key features of suitable brood habitat are moderately dense herbaceous layer and brushy cover nearby (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  On an island in Georgia, broods used low areas within oak-pine and pine forests, particularly along grassy edges of ponds and openings along ditches, as well as a complex of old fields, Bahia grass fields, grassy depressions, and regenerated pine and oak habitats (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).\r\n\r\nPastures, fields, and woodlands are used during fall (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  During winter, mixed, uneven-aged pine and hardwood stands (including bottomland hardwoods) are primarily used but grassy habitats used in summer and fall are still used too.  In spring, male turkeys in the Coastal Plains spend much of their time foraging and displaying in open areas.  Non-nesting hens used upland and bottomland forests in a study from Alabama (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  Another found little use of upland forests by both sexes (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).  Mature pine, pine-hardwood, and some pine plantations are used along forest edges (Hurst and Dickinson 1992).\r\n\r\nSuitable habitats in Florida include; large islands, cypress forests, and cypress trees surrounding the Big Cypress Swamp, bald cypress-sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) swamps, bottomland hardwood forests of deciduous trees such as hackberry, black gum, sweet gum, red maple, cypress, swamp chestnut oak, and American hornbeam and evergreens such as live oak, laurel oak, water oak, American holly and sweet bay, hardwood hammocks associated with small sloughs, glades, shallow ponds, small, improved pastures, mixed-pine and hardwood uplands, glades with short grasses and isolated live oaks (Quercus virginiana), longleaf pine forest with wire grass and turkey oak, grassy forest openings, prairie edges in the southern part of the state, and Cliftonia-oak communities in the north-central part (Eaton 1992, Williams Jr. 1992).  Large cypress ponds can be used for roosting and small shallow ponds may be used as brood habitat if they are alternately burned and flooded (Williams Jr. 1992).  Turkeys forage in sloughs and roost in trees within them if present.  Sloughs are more desirable than prairies and treeless glades are rarely used (Williams Jr. 1992).  Turkeys are only found in pine islands within the Everglades (Williams Jr. 1992).  \r\n\r\nTurkeys in Florida do not inhabit places where tree cover is too sparse or understory is too dense (Williams Jr. 1992).  Marshes, densely vegetated forest clearcuts, and unburned pine woods are not used for foraging (Williams Jr. 1992).  Only the margins of bayheads are used and only for predator cover and roosting (Williams Jr. 1992).  Swamps of cypress, sweet bay, red bay, red maple, water oak, and black gum within flatwoods are only used for cover or roosting (Williams Jr. 1992).  Only the edges of oak scrub habitats composed of scrub oaks, scrub hickory, and other dwarf shrubs are used because it is too dense (Williams Jr. 1992).  Only the edges (within 200 m) of treeless palmetto prairies (also called dry prairies or treeless savannas) are used by nesting turkeys because of the lack of tree cover and the density of the vegetation (Williams Jr. 1992).  Productivity is low within large patches of longleaf pine woods but high in areas with stream bottoms, hammocks, or cypress swamps (Williams Jr. 1992).  Slash pine flatwoods that are not subjected to periodic fires that thin the understory become too dense for foraging turkeys.  If burned, they are marginal habitat due to low mast production (Williams Jr. 1992).\r\n\r\nIn the Piedmont ecoregion, turkeys also thrive in areas that have a diversity of habitats (i.e., forests and fields; Bailey et al. 1981).  Savanna-like clearings and grassy clearings are important foraging habitat for broods (Bailey et al. 1981).  Mixed forests with open understories, 50% hardwood cover, and 25% mast producing hardwoods, such as oaks, provide good habitat (Bailey et al. 1981).  Nests are usually placed in thickets within fields or forest openings (Bailey et al. 1981). \r\n\r\nIn the Northeast, Wild Turkeys are found in oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) forests, forests with red oak (Quercus rubra), beech (Fagus grandifolia), cherry (Prunus serotina), white ash (Fraxinus americana; Eaton 1992).  In the Blue Ridge, Ridge and Valley, Allegheny Plateau, Cumberland Plateau, and Interior Low Plateau regions, mature hardwood forests that contain canopy openings, patches of herbaceous undergrowth, and mast-producing trees are valuable turkey habitat (Wunz and Pack 1992).  Turkeys require some open habitats, but they are abundant in some heavily forested landscapes (Wunz and Pack 1992).  They use pine-oak forests, forests dominated by hickory with sourwood (Oxydendron arboretum), huckleberry (Gaylussacia sp.), blueberry (Vaccinium), mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), and greenbriar (Smilax sp.) in the understory, clearings, stream banks, pole and sawtimber sized stands of cove hardwoods, cherry-maple, northern hardwoods, white oak, mixed oak and mixed hardwood stands (Healy 1981).  Small pole-timber hardwood stands are used if they produce mast and are near herbaceous open areas (Wunz and Pack 1992).  Young, dense pine forests are not used (Wunz and Pack 1992).  Turkeys\u2019 use of clearcuts changes as the cutover area moves through the stages of succession.  The edges may be used for nesting and brood habitat during the first 10 years.  As tree cover develops, turkeys will venture into the interiors to feed on remaining herbaceous vegetation.  When saplings and small pole sized trees shade out the ground (after about 10 years), they rarely utilize the interiors.  When trees mature and begin producing mast (after about 50 years), they return to the area (Wunz and Pack 1992).\r\n\r\nNests are placed in upland and stream-bottom hardwood forests in huckleberry and green briar thickets, laurel and huckleberry understories, brushy clearcuts, and uncut hay among other habitats (Wunz and Pack 1992).  Most nests are within 200 m of water (Healy 1981).  Broods use glades, savannas, utility right-of-ways, pastures, hayfields, abandoned fields, and sometimes forests if midstories and understories provide enough cover and food (Wunz and Pack 1992).  Early successional herbaceous and shrub habitats are favorable for broods if near trees (Wunz and Pack 1992).  Young broods use savanna like habitats with an abundance of grasses and forbs and beech-birch-maple forests, black cherry forests, white oak stands, black cherry, or yellow-poplar, even if the presence of grasses and forbs or an open structure is maintained by livestock grazing (Healy 1981).  As poults grow, they continue to use these habitats but also become capable of utilizing areas with more dense understories and closed canopies, including thickets (Healy 1981).  However, forests with dense ericaceous understories (e.g., Rhododendron sp.) are avoided.  \r\n\r\nWith the onset of winter, turkeys shift their habitat use from grassy forest openings and savannas to forests where they can exploit mast produced by oaks and other hardwoods (Healy 1981).  Turkeys on Middle Mountain in West Virginia used mixed hardwood, white oak-red oak-hickory, red oak-scarlet oak, chestnut oak, and oak-pine forests but not yellow pine and pine-hemlock forests (Healy 1981).\r\nThey range over large areas of forests to feed, and when snow accumulates, seeps become very important microhabitats where they forage on invertebrates, green vegetation, and mast (Porter 1992, Wunz and Pack 1992).  Healy (1981) characterized the best seeps as being a forest with black cherry, red oak (Quercus rubra), white ash, and beech (Fagus grandifolia), having 50 to 100% canopy cover, southern aspect, slope < 20%, diffuse outlets, and a mucky area that is 15 m2 or larger (Wunz and Pack 1992).  At high elevations, conifer stands in bottomlands are used for shelter (Wunz and Pack 1992).\r\n\r\nNest and brood microhabitats used in the Interior Highlands and eastern Central Lowlands are similar to those used in the Southeast and Appalachians (Lewis 1992).  A radio-telemetry study of habitat use in north-central Missouri found grasslands with scattered trees were the most preferred habitat followed by cropland, semi-open woodlands, and semi-open grasslands, forest with scattered pine trees, and pasture (Lewis 1992).  Old fields, pastures, crop fields, forest edges,and oak-hickory forests are used during winter (Lewis 1992).  Wastegrains on cultivated croplands are a valuable food in winter (Lewis 1992).\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, turkeys inhabit landscapes of second-growth oaks or northern hardwoods, conifer swamps, pine plantations, and agricultural fields (Wunz 1992).  Oak-hickory wooded ridges and hills in agricultural landscapes are inhabited in Wisconsin and Minnesota (Wunz 1992).\r\n\r\nIn the Great Plains prairies, turkeys use riparian woodlands, grassland edges, and foothill shrubs, pinon-juniper woodlands, foothill riparian forests, and in agricultural areas (see Merriam\u2019s Turkey habitat description, Andrews and Righter 1992).  They are found along the Missouri River in hardwood draws, woodlots, riparian woodlands, and pastures, and in South Dakota\u2019s riparian corridors of cottonwood and ash in prairies and fragmented woodlands of cottonwood, ash, bur oak, and hickory (Wunz 1992).  In Nebraska, they inhabit deciduous communities of box elder, cottonwood, green ash, chokecherry, snowberry, and prairie rose, shelterbelts and adjacent croplands and pastures, and open stands of ponderosa pine with mid- and short-grass understories along the Pine Ridge (Wunz 1992).  Turkeys in the central and southern Great Plains inhabit mesquite grasslands, hilly areas scattered with mesquite, pine, and scrub oak, mesic wooded sites with live oak, pecan (Carya illinoiensis), American elm (Ulmus americana), cedar elm (U. crassifolia), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), netleaf hackberry (C. reticulata) and cottonwood (Populus deltoids; Eaton 1992).  Ecotones between grazed glades and low oak scrub are among those used by nesting hens (Healy 1981).  \r\n\r\nIn the central and southern Rocky Mountains, turkeys inhabit ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) woodlands, pinyon-juniper zones, pine-oak-grasslands, and edges of meadows (See Merriam\u2019s Turkey habitat description, Vasquez 2005).  In Colorado, they primarily inhabit ponderosa pine forests with an understory of Gambel oak.  Tall pines are used at all seasons for roosting (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Riparian hardwood corridors, extensive ponderosa pine forests that have open understories, and shrublands of chokecherry, snowberry, and Oregon grape are inhabited in Montana (Wunz 1992).  In Idaho and Wyoming, they are found in ponderosa pine forests, riparian hardwood communities, and single-leaf pinyon-juniper communities along the Utah border (Wunz 1992).  Along the lower Clearwater River, they inhabit western red cedar, western hemlock, grand fir, and Douglas fir (Wunz 1992).  On the eastern slope of the Big Horn Mountains, they inhabit ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine communities, hawthorn thickets, and riparian cottonwood dominated communities.  In central Utah, they inhabit riparian cottonwood and oak communities (Wunz 1992).  On mountains and plateaus, they live between 1,500 and 2,700 m in pondersosa pine, pinyon-pine, aspen, Gambel oak forest and associated meadows and other openings (Wunz 1992).\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande Subspecies (M. g. Intermedia) occurs in central Texas and Oklahoma (Beason and Wilson 1992).  It inhabits plains grasslands, shinnery, prairie, oak-hickory, oak-pine, pinyon-juniper, Texas savanna, and southwestern shrubsteppe (Beason and Wilson 1992), and prefers cottonwood river bottoms associated with oak-pine and pinyon-juniper forests (Mock et al. 2001).  Turkeys on the Edwards Plateau utilize juniper brakes in draws, riparian woodlands, and riparian savannas (but to a lesser degree than woodlands; Beason and Wilson 1992).  Roost sites are an important component of suitable Rio Grande Turkey habitat and they use a variety of tree species, only tree height seems to be important (Beason and Wilson 1992).  Winter roost sites are often in riparian areas but can be far (900 m) from permanent water.  Live oaks and clumps of tall mesquite are among suitable summer roosts (Beason and Wilson 1992).  In spring, habitat use shifts from cropland-riparian-upland savanna complexes to more open, upland plant communities, such as roads, right-of-ways, mowed areas, disturbed sites, mesquite prairie, live oak chaparral, mesquite-bristle grass, or short grasslands (Beason and Wilson 1992).  During summer, gobblers strut in open areas and forage in open woodlands or other habitats with trees and open, grassy ground cover.  Hens nest in road-side right-of-ways with tall grasses and in herbaceous vegetation over 18 inches with little bluestem, Canada wild rye, Texas winter grass, Johnsongrass, sunflower, Texas virgin\u2019s bower, buffalo gourd, granjeno, agarita, persimmon, and spiny aster among other plants (Beason and Wilson 1992).  Hen and brood activity centers around herbaceous vegetation near cover.  Hay meadows and mixed grass-shrub habitats are among those used (Beason and Wilson 1992).  Habitat use shifts back toward riparian woodlands with plants such as hackberry during fall (Beason and Wilson 1992).\r\n\r\nTurkeys inhabit every \u201csubstantial pine-forested upland\u201d in Arizona (Wunz 1992).  The Peloncillo Mountains in Arizona host the Mexican Turkey subspecies, which inhabits border pinyon-Tourney oak-bull muhly savanna, emory oak-bear grass-side oats grama steppe, Tourney oak-manzanita chaparral, Emory oak-canyon grape, Arizona white oak (Quercus arizonica)-bull muhly, Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla)-silverleaf oak (Quercus hypoleucoides), and pinyon-pinyon rice grass (Piptochaetium fimbriatum) communities (See Mexican Turkey habitat description, Schemnitz and Zeedyk 1992).  They also used 3 riparian habitat types: canyon bottoms with Chihuahua pines and an understory of silverleaf oak, riparian habitat dominated by Arizona oak and bull muhly grass, and riparian habitat with abundant large Emory oaks and an understory of canyon grape (Vitis arizonica). \r\n\r\nTurkeys are found in all mountainous areas of New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002), and are listed as a rare permanent resident of White Sands Missile Range (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  They are uncommon residents of lava beds at El Malpais National Monument and National Conservation Area (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Cottonwood and tamarisk bosques are used along the Rio Grande River (Wunz 1992).\r\n\r\nTurkeys live in California in savannas with ponderosa pine, digger pine, and usually oaks and a grassy understory between 150 and 900 m (Wunz 1992).  In interior Oregon, the inhabit areas with ponderosa pine, oaks, and backbrush ceanothus (Wunz 1992).  On the east slope of the Cascades, they live in ponderosa pine forests with Douglas fir, snowberry, and Oregon white oak (Wunz 1992).  Turkeys have been release in fir-oak communities along the Columbia River and in a landscape with Douglas fir-deciduous forest (big-leaf maple, red alder, and black cottonwood) interspersed with agricultural lands (Wunz 1992).\r\n\r\nN.
