Fresh, brackish, and saltwater, including mangroves, are also suitable (NatureServe 2009).  They rely upon the availability of wetlands, running, or standing water for foraging, nearby perches for roosting, and earthen banks that are suitable for excavating nest cavities (Fry & Fry 1992, Hamel 1992).  The availability of nest burrow sites, perches, and prey have strong influences on the distribution and abundance of this species (Kelly et al. 2009).\r\n\r\nKingfishers hunt primarily small fish by diving into clear water while hovering or flying slowly (Hamel 1992), so they prefer waters that are not obscured or overgrown by vegetation (Kelly et al. 2009).  Most fish are caught <60 cm below the surface of the water and adults have been reported foraging up to 8 km from their nests (Kelly et al. 2009).  They will eat other aquatic animals, such as crayfish (Kelly et al. 2009).\r\n\r\nBelted Kingfishers build nests inside a burrow that they excavate near the top of a bank or a cliff in sandy, clay soil (Hamel 1992, Harrison 1975).  They sometimes nest in other places such as embankments, ditches, road cuts, mounds, gravel pits, mudslides made by beavers, impacted soil in the roots of a fallen tree, tree holes, sand pits and even sawdust heaps (Kelly et al. 2009).   Nest burrows are long tunnels four inches wide and three to six feet deep, although 10 to 15 feet deep burrows have been reported (Harrison 1975, Potter et al 1980).  The landscapes surrounding burrows may include a wide array of terrestrial communities.   An examination of habitat use by kingfishers along grazed streams in Pennsylvania found that kingfishers did not use grazed streams (Popotkin and Giuliano 2000).\r\n\r\nBelted Kingfishers are found throughout North Carolina, although they are less common above 3,000 ft. (Hamel 1992, Simpson 1992).   They are scarce in arid regions of the U.S., particularly the central grasslands and deserts (Kelly et al. 2009).  In New Mexico, they occur on practically all clear-water ponds, streams, lakes from the lowest altitudes to more than 9,000 feet (Hamas 1994), but they are absent above 9,000 ft (2,750 m) in most of the Rocky Mountains (Kelly et al. 2009).  In Nevada, they are a common resident of lakes, ponds, and rivers although they are not abundant (SWreGAP).\r\n\r\nThe winter habitat associations of Belted Kingfishers are similar to those of the summer.
