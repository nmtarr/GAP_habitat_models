It is found in well-developed desert, plains grassland, scrub-grassland, Great Basin and Chihuahuan desertscrub, marginal and interior dunes at White Sands National Monument, Havard's oak dunes, shortgrass plains, sacaton grasslands, well-developed grasslands (avoids basins of low grass cover), scrub or brush-covered slopes on gravelly soil generally occupied by creosote or acacias, arid/semiarid grassland, grassy bajadas (not too dense or too tall), juniper savannah, Great Basin sagebrush, mid and lower bajadas, and barren mesa tops (Best 1988, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2001). The species is common northwest of Albuquerque where elevation increases, areas of clayey soil increase, grasses (ex: Bouteloua and Hilaria) become common, and cholla and some junipers replace sand sage, Dalea and Atriplex (Thompson et al. 1996).  D. spectabilis is found at the base of alluvial fans in the Huachuca Mountains of Arizona and in firm gravelly soil of the Santa Rita Mountains in Arizona (Best 1988).  It eats sand dropseed near Albuquerque, but in southern Arizona the main food is Rothrock's grama (Best 1988).  It eats needle grama, spiderling, needlegrass, green carpetweed, purple grama seeds, Humboldt needlegrass seeds, sixweeks needlegrass seeds, and rough needlegrass seeds (Hoffmeister 1986, Best 1988).  It occurs at elevations of 610-1,829m (Hoffmeister 1986). The home range varies from 0.4-0.7 ha (Davis and Schmidly 1997).  78% of the nocturnal active period is spent within 6m of the burrow (Best 1988).  D. spectabilis prefers heavier soils for burrow system stability (Thompson et al. 1996).  It prefers coarse soils, firm and solid, or hard, gravelly soils (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It has been found in areas with pans (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The mean body temperature of D. spectabilis acclimated to 25 degrees C is constant at ambient temperatures from -5 C to 15 C (Best 1988).  Though surface temperatures may vary widely, burrow temperatures tend to remain at ~27 C (Best 1988).  D. spectabilis occurs in southern Arizona east of Ajo and in the northeast near Chinle and Navajo Mountain (Hoffmeister 1986). It could potentially occur in southern La Plata or Montezuma counties in Colorado, most likely on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species is found in the southern two thirds of New Mexico except on the Mogollon Plateau and in the San Juan River Basin (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). Occurs at Black Mountain, and Copper Mountain, Valley of the Ajo.  Found in the Manzano Mountains, Animas Mountains, Santa Rita Mountains, Pinaleno Mountains, Huachuca, Ajo, Chiricahua, San Mateo, Patagonia Mountains, Baboquivari Mountains, Dos Cabezas Mountains, Datil Mountains, and the Gallinas. In Texas, this species is found from the central Trans-Pecos region and east and north to Reagan and Lubbock counties. It inhabits sparsely brush-covered slopes and low hills at elevations between 1200 and 1500 meters. In the Trans-Pecos it is most abundant on slopes covered with scattered, mixed stands of creosote brush and acacias on hard and moderately gravelly soils (quoted directly from Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBTKRx", "ELCode": "AMAFD03110", "scientific_name": "Dipodomys spectabilis", "ITIS_TSN": "180246", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103225", "common_name": "Banner-tailed Kangaroo Rat"}}
