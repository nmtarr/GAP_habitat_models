Great Egrests forage in a wide variety of wetland habitats including marshes, swamps, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, impoundments, lagoons, tidal flats, rice fields, canals, mangrove coastal marshes, pastures, and ditches.  They also feed in flooded agricultural fields and some upland habitats (McCrimmon et al. 2001, Stevenson and Anderson 1994).  \r\n\r\nGreat Egrets join other wading birds to nest in colonies within woody vegetation, shrubs, and trees over water or on natural and dredge spoil islands located in and around lakes, ponds, marshes, estuaries, and impoundments.  The list of plant species on which nests have been placed include redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) in California, tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in Texas, live oak (Quercus virginiana), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria), and wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera) in North Carolina, and red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia nitida), Australian pine (Casuarina equestifolia), buttonwood (Conocarpus erecta), Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa), black willow (Salix nigra), and privet (Forestiera porulosa) in Florida (McCrimmon et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nThe distances between nest colonies and foraging areas are highly variable, can be very long, and often reflect the quality of surrounding habitat.  Of 422 individuals from 12 colonies followed in the Everglades, the average distance traveled to foraging sites was 6.3 km.   Over 70% of flights were <6.0 km in length, and the longest was >40 km (McCrimmon et al. 2001).  The average distance flown from a colony along the upper Mississippi was 8.4 km (McCrimmon et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nThe Great Egret breeds in all Southwestern states, but infrequently in the deserts and grasslands (Davis, 1997).  Breeding populations exist in the Lower Colorado River Valley and Salton Sea, with a few colonies found in other low elevations areas with permanent water sources.  Breeding may be limited by availability of tall riparian trees for nesting, although citrus groves have been used near Yuma, AZ.  In Colorado, Great Egrets are rare but individuals have been observed on the eastern plains, mountain parks, and western valleys, and breeding has been confirmed at 2 sites.  In Utah, it is considered a rare permanent resident, although breeding activities have yet to be verified (UDWR, 2003).  It is common at Bitter Lake, New Mexico, and a summer resident in Nevada (Alcorn, 1988).  During winter, scattered flocks and individuals often seen along larger rivers in southern and western Arizona. \r\n\r\nWinter habitat associations are similar to those during the breeding season (McCrimmon et al. 2001).
