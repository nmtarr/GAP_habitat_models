They breed in medium to mature woods, where dead trees or stubs are present for nesting. Hamel (1992) asserts they are most common in mixed pine-hardwoods and pinewoods, and less common in pure hardwood forests, while Kaufman (1996) states they are 'mostly in deciduous forests.'  Also occur in woodland edges, suburban areas, and wooded parks (Hamel 1992, Simpson 1992). Nest in cavities, either excavated by the breeding pair or existing cavity such old woodpecker hole (Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996, Potter et al 1980). Cavities usually dug out in 'softwood of fence post, decaying stump, or dead stub on a living tree,' according to Potter et al (1980).\r\nIn se. U.S., inhabits: (1) swamp forests consisting of oak (Quercus sp.), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), black gum (N. sylvatica), sweetgum (Liquidamber styraciflua), and cypress (Taxodium sp.); (2) maritime/riparian hardwood forests of (a) live oak (Q. virginiana); (b) elm (Ulmus spp.), ash (Fraxinus spp.), and cottonwood (Populus deltoides or P. heterophylla); (3) mid- to late-successional mesic hardwood forests of (a) American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora); (b) tulip (yellow) poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), basswood (Tilia heterophylla), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), buckeye (Aesculus octandra), and white oak (Q. alba); (c) sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch (Betula lutea); (4) upland hardwood forests of scrub oaks; (5) mid- to late-successional mixed pine (Pinus)-hardwood forests of (a) loblolly pine (P. taeda), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), and oak spp.; (b) sand pine (P. clausa) and scrub oaks; (c) longleaf pine (P. palustris) and scrub oaks; and (d) longleaf pine and mixed hardwoods; (e) white pine (P. strobus), oaks, and hickories (Carya spp.); (6) mid- to late-successional pine forests of (a) loblolly pine and shortleaf pine; (b) scrub pine (P. virginiana) and pitch pine (P. rigida); (c) white pine and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis); and (d) longleaf pine (Hamel 1992). Throughout range, inhabits parks and well-wooded suburban and even urban areas (e.g., Hadidian et al. 1997)(quoted directly from Mostrom et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nRestricted in southwestern part of range to riverine habitats (Harrap and Quinn 1995). In Great Plain states, found in tree-shrub-savanna communities, but not in prairie grasslands and dry-belt pine forests (Bent 1946, Root 1988)(quoted directly from Mostrom et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nAll Regions:\r\nIn mountains, ranges to 1,850 m in absence of Black-capped Chickadees (Bent 1946, Tanner 1952, Kendeigh and Fawver 1981); upper-elevation limit possibly lower (1,000\u20131,200 m) in presence of Black-capped Chickadees, which reside typically at higher elevations, with or without gap in altitudinal distribution during breeding season (Tanner 1952, Johnston 1971, Pitts 1997).
