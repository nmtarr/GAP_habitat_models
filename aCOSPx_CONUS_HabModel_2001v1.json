In Mexico, this species occurs in the tip of Baja California, but also extends through San Luis Potosi, south central Veracruz into Nayarit. Records of isolated populations in California between Amos and Ogilby on the eastern side of the Algodones Dunes; Buzzard\u2019s Peak and Purgatory Washes, Imperial County and 24 kilometers north of Vidal Junction in San Bernardino County. Isolated populations in Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona (Conant and Collins 1998; Degenhardt et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003). Reports of this species are lacking from their historical habitat where it has been converted into urban settlements and agricultural areas (Lannoo 2005).\r\nHabitat associated with this species includes areas of low rainfall, mesquite savanna, creosote bush desert, shortgrass prairie, and the tropical deciduous forests of Mexico (Stebbins 2003). Associated with mesquite, mesquite-yucca, and creosote deserts (Bragg 1944; Mayhew 1965). Found in shortgrass plains in its arid to semiarid occupied areas (Conant and Collins 1998). In Arizona, this species is mainly associated with grasslands and desertscrub communities where is most often seen during the monsoon Brennan and Holycross 2009). Soil is characterized as sandy and well drained (Degenhardt et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nBreeding occurs in rain filled areas such as playas, isolated pools in arroyos, stock tanks, temporary pools formed at the bases of railway and road grades (Morey 1994). There evidence suggesting a habitat difference between the juveniles and adults due to juveniles\u2019 inability burrow, they occupy cracks and small mammal burrows (Ruibal et al. 1969).\r\n\r\nSW\t-Associated with desertscrub and grassland communities (Brennan and Holycross 2009). Shortgrass prairie, mesquite savannah and creosote bush desert (Behler and King 1979).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCOSPx", "ELCode": "AAABF01020", "scientific_name": "Scaphiopus couchii", "ITIS_TSN": "173429", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105658", "common_name": "Couch's Spadefoot"}}
