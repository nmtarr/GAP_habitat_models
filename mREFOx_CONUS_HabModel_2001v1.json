Preferences are for fragmented, heterogenous landscapes where prey availability is a more important factor than vegetation or physiographic components of their perceived landscape (Lloyd 1980, Catling and Burt 1995, Harris and Rayner 1986, Lariviere and Pasitschniak-Arts 1996). The species prefers brushy habitats, avoiding mature hardwoods, during winter in temperate areas (Halpin and Bissonette 1988, Theberge and Wedeles 1989). Various open and semi-open habitats. Usually avoids dense forest, although open woodlands frequently are used. Sometimes occurs in suburban areas or even cities (e.g., in England). May range onto sea ice (Labrador). Maternity dens are in burrows dug by fox or abandoned by other mammals, often in open fields or wooded areas, sometimes under rural buildings, in hollow logs, under stumps, etc. (NatureServe).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nMost common in open woodlands, pasturelands, riparian and agricultural lands. It favors areas with a mixture of those vegetations types occuring in small mosaics with good development of ground cover. In mountains, they occur in montane and subalpine meadows, alpine and forest edges. Usually near water. Occurs in northeastern Arizona, in northern Apache and Navajo counties (Hoffmeister 1986). Red foxes occur only in wooded areas in the northeastern part of this region. Open country is a common element in all of their habitats - from agricultural woodlets interspersed with cropland and grass pastureland to alpine tundra. Found in suitable habitats throughout the region and Rocky Mountain National Park. In our region, it is a chiefly montane species. Red foxes generally prefer areas with a reasonable amount of rainfall and vegetation. Good rodent populations probably play a part in making an area suitable.  The species is common in Utah where it is a primarily found in open and semi-open habitats, although it also occassionally occurs in heavily forested areas, cities, suburban settings (UDWR 2003).  The red fox may be excluded from otherwise preferred habitats when coyotes are present.  Usually avoids dense forest, although open woodlands are frequently used.  Red foxes were introduced from Great Britain/Europe into many parts of the United States and consequently across the states, though there is some evidence to suggest they are native to North America. The Sierra Nevada red fox (V. v. necator) is native and is associated with high elevations. Can be found in the following mountain ranges:Sangre de Cristo Mountains; San Juan Mountains; Jemez Mountains; Mogollon Mountains.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nRed foxes were probably introduced into the southeatern Unites States prior to 1900 (Kamler and Ballard 2002). In North America, they are native to boreal areas, potentially including the high elevations of the Appalachians (Kamler and Ballard 2002). They tend to use open, upland grassland and srcub areas along forest edges and tend to avoid swamps and hammocks (Layne et al. 1977).They are reported to frequent marsh habitats in southern california and are a threat to nesting birds in these habitats (Harding et al. 2001), however red fox use of coastal marsh habitats in the southeast is not reported. Gosselink et al. (2003) found that red foxes avoided areas used by coyotes and frequented more human habitat types in agriculutral and residential settings. Overall there is little information on fox use of habitats in the Southeast. Rosenblatt (1999) detected red foxes in forest fragments greater than 24 ha. In an agrcultural landscape in Illinois.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mREFOx", "ELCode": "AMAJA03010", "scientific_name": "Vulpes vulpes", "ITIS_TSN": "180604", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105935", "common_name": "Red Fox"}}
