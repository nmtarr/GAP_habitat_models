Found also in some of the lower Florida Keys; Isolated populations are reported in extreme west South Carolina (Conant and Collins 1998). Recently, the southern toad has become uncommon in Florida because of non-native marine toad (Rhinella marina) (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999).\r\n\r\nIts preferred habitat can be characterized as predominantly sandy (Conant and Collins 1998). For breeding, they prefer shallow waters, lake margins, ephemeral ponds (Cypress ponds and wooded ponds), and other upland sandy habitats; breeding does not occur in streams or rivers (Lannoo 2005). Adults spend time in agricultural fields, hammocks, maritime forests, gardens, and pine woodlands (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSOTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01160", "scientific_name": "Anaxyrus terrestris", "ITIS_TSN": "773531", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100109", "common_name": "Southern Toad"}}
