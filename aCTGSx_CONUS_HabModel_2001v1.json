Populations occur from the bottom of the Central Valley up to 1200 meters in the Coast Ranges, and about 500 meters in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada (Storer 1925; Jennings and Hayes 1994; Fisher and Shaffer 1996; Lannoo 2005; Stebbins 2003).\r\nPopulations are presumed to exist in the vernal pool and grassland habitat that used to dominate the region. Some disjunct populations occur near Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, to the southwest in Santa Maria region of northwestern Santa Barbara County (Storer 1925; Jennings and Hayes 1994; Fisher and Shaffer 1996; Lannoo 2005). Recent records show a significant loss of habitat and few reported populations are found in the Central Valley, with most reports from the surrounding hills in the east and west (California Department of Game and Fish, 2002), due to conversion to intensive agriculture. Threats to this species also includes the introduction of western tiger salamander (Green et al. 2013).This species is known to breed in wetlands devoid of fish that are described as seasonal to semi-permanent (Barry and Shaffer 1994; Petranka 1998). Previous records describe the habitat as exclusively shallow vernal pools for breeding, but now reports include ponds constructed for cattle that are found in foothill habitat in Monterey County (Trenham et al. 2001). Egg deposition occurs on live vegetation and detritus (Storer 1925; Twitty 1941; Lannoo 2005).\r\nNewly metamorphosed individuals have been reported to occupy squirrel burrows and soil cracks (Loredo et al. 1996), while in a site near Lake Lagunita at Standford University, juveniles were reported in crevices in a sandbag retaining wall (Barry and Shaffer 1994). Adults have an association with rodent burrows as underground retreats with the exception during breeding season (Loredo et al. 1996). These burrows are found in open grassland areas, beneath large oaks, while the ones in woodland areas are less occupied (Trenham 2001).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCTGSx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01180", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma californiense", "ITIS_TSN": "173595", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104488", "common_name": "California Tiger Salamander"}}
