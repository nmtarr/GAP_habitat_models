Also, this species is found in some coastal islands eastward up to an altitude of 800 meters in the Washington Cascades (Slater 1955; Lannoo 2005). In Oregon, a report from a single specimen exists from Boring, southeast of Portland. Otherwise, this species is apparently absent from the northern portion of the Oregon Cascades. In the south of Oakridge in Lane County, this species resumes occupancy in the Cascades, but only north of the Umpqua River in Douglas County at about 1250m (Storm and Brodie 1970; Green et al. 2013; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nThe habitat associated with this species includes mixed coniferous forests and are common in Douglas fir throughout their range (Nussbaum et al. 1983). This species is known to be associated with young forest stands (Petranka 1998), and actually occur across all forest stand ages.\r\nEgg deposition sites may include the roofs and sides of cavities under rocks, or in rocks, and decaying logs (Peacock and Nussbaum 1973; Norman and Swartwood 1991). Hatchlings have been reported to be abundant in autumn and early winter on the forest floor (Petranka 1998). During dry conditions, juveniles have been described to have higher activity levels than adults (Ovaska and Gregory 1989). As adults, members of this species are found under logs, bark, stones, and in moss in cool, shaded areas (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Corn and Bury 1991). Strong association exists with rocky seeps, small streams, and springs in the northern Puget Trough and the Cascade Range foothills in Washington (Leonard 1996; Petranka 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aWRBSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12200", "scientific_name": "Plethodon vehiculum", "ITIS_TSN": "173672", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100174", "common_name": "Western Red-backed Salamander"}}
