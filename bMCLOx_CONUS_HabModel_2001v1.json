Typical breeding habitat is a matrix of perennial shortgrass species.\r\n\r\nWinter habitat similar to those utilized during breeding season and includes open habitats with sparse vegetation such as shortgrass prairie, overgrazed pastures, plowed fields, and dry lake beds (playas)(quoted directly from With 2010).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe McCown\u2019s Longspur (Calcarius mccownii) breeds in the short-grass prairie of the Great Plains from the Pawnee National Grasslands in northern Colorado north to the southern edge of the Canadian Prairie Provinces in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, east to western North Dakota and western Nebraska (With 1994). They winter from western Oklahoma to southeast Arizona south into northern Mexico (With 1994). In addition, they may rarely winter in southeastern Colorado and near the foothills (Andrews and Righter 1992, With 1994). In migration, this longspur also occurs as a rare transient in Utah and Nevada (Hayward et al. 1976, Ryser 1985, With 1994). \r\nBreeding habitat for the McCown\u2019s Longspur in the southwest is restricted to open habitats and sparse vegetation (With 1994). Breeding habitats on the Pawnee National Grasslands are short-grass prairies that are dominated by buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) interspersed with cactus (Opuntia polyacantha) (Knopf 1994). McCown\u2019s Longspurs have evolved with grazing ungulates and will inhabit and nest in areas where overgrazing often occurs (Andrews and Righter 1992, Knopf 1994). Heavily grazed pastures and areas with sparse vegetation seem to be the preferred habitats for these birds (With 1994). Wintering and migratory habitats are similar to those of breeding habitats. These are also open habitats with sparse vegetation such as short-grass prairie, overgrazed pastures, plowed fields, and dry lakebeds (With 1994). \r\nThe data for the range in elevation is from the Colorado Wildlife Species Database (Schrupp and Cade 1989), Ligon 1961, and the Biota Information System of New Mexico (BISON-M).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nWintering habitat in w. Texas at the Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge: most abundant on lightly grazed pastures (a Bouteloua-Buchloe matrix interspersed with other grass species: Sporobolus, Hilaria mutica, Erioneuron pilosum, shrubs Gutierrezia sarothrae, and forbs Castilleja); vegetation height < 0.5 m (Grzybowski 1982). Playa wetlands managed for waterfowl in the Southern High Plains of Texas also attracted winter feeding flocks of McCown\u2019s Longspurs (Smith et al. 2004)(quoted directly from With 2010).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bMCLOx", "ELCode": "ABPBXA6010", "scientific_name": "Calcarius mccownii", "ITIS_TSN": "179525", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101543", "common_name": "Mccown's Longspur"}}
