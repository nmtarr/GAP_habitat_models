In Arizona, it is found primarily in Chihuahuan, Sonoran and Mojavean desertscrub communities (Hoffmeister 1986). At the Santa Rita Experimental Range, Pima County, this mouse selected for areas containing a prevalence of burroweed, a scarcity of perennial grasses and bare patches of compact soil; mice were rarely caught in burroweed, but more frequently next to cacti, perennial grasses or mesquite (Langley 1980). At the Santa Rita Experimental Range, this species occurred in desert characterized by Prosopis juliflora, Opuntia fulgida, O. englemannii, Aplopappus tenuisectus (Langley 1980). In the San Simon Valley near Portal, this species was trapped within Larrea tridentate (84.1% shrub cover; Chew and Chew 1970). In Nevada, this grasshopper mouse is known to occur within the Lower Sonoran Life-Zone (Hall 1946). West of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, this mouse was trapped in creosote desert characterized by Ichaenactis, Chorizanthe, Cryptantha, Phacelia, Eriogonum, Hilaria rigida, Oryzopsis hymenoides and Bromus rubens (n = 17; Bradley and Mauer 1973). \r\n\r\nHistorically, in southern Nevada, this species was trapped in open desert (Burt 1936); a specific vegetation type was not provided. In Utah, it was identified within the Saint George Basin within Clistoyucca-Larrea Associations, which is characterized by Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia), creosote, Lycium andersoni, Franseria dumosa, Eurotia lanata, Ephedra nevadensis, Krameria glandulosa, Hilaria rigida and Muhlenbergia porteri (Hardy 1945). In the Virgin River Province, southwestern most portion of the state, Honeycutt et al. (1981) identified this species most often within creosote bush communities, which was represented by Larrea tridentata, Franseria dumosa, Bromus rubens, Yucca brevifolia, Yucca spp., and Opuntia spp. The desertshrub systems listed below fit the above information and are known to occur within the known range of this species. Therefore, inclusion of this system is justified. This species is expected to occur in these systems year round where suitable habitat is present.\r\n\r\nHistorically, in Nevada, this species was trapped in small ravines or near water; however, they may also be found in open desert (Burt 1936).\r\n\r\nIn Arizona, this species was trapped at 4500 feet (1367 meters) south of Portal, Cochise, County, Arizona and 4400 feet (1333 meters) in Antelope Pass, west Animas Mountains, Hidalgo County, New Mexico (Hinesley and Thaeler 1979). In Nevada, a general elevational range for the state is from 500 to 7200 feet elevation (152-2182 meters; Hall 1946). West of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, this mouse was trapped at around 2500 feet (758 meters; n = 17; Bradley and Mauer 1973), and in Pershing County, Nevada at 3900 feet (1182 meters; Engstrom and Fleharty 1978). Historically in Utah, this species has been identified to occur in the southwestern corner of the state within the southern-half of Washington County from 2600 to 3300 feet (789-1100 meters) elevation (n = 27; Durrant 1952).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSGMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF06020", "scientific_name": "Onychomys torridus", "ITIS_TSN": "180383", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103432", "common_name": "Southern Grasshopper Mouse"}}
