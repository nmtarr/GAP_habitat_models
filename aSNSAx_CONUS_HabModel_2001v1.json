They are most commonly found in riffles and shallow, rocky streams with loose gravel and moderately fast-flowing water provide favorable conditions.  Shovelnose salamanders are intolerant of siltation and need clean, cold, fast-flowing water.  They are known from only a few watersheds within their geographic range.  They lay 2-4 dozen eggs in June or July and attach them to the undersides of rocks or logs in main current of stream.  Females stays with eggs during 2.5-month development.  Their totally aquatic larvae metamorphose in one to three years.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSNSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03170", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus marmoratus", "ITIS_TSN": "550398", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101588", "common_name": "Shovel-nosed Salamander"}}
