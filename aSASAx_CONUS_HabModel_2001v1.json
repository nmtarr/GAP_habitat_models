This species inhabits springs in association with the Balcones Escarpment near Salado Creek at 183 meters in elevation (Green et al. 2013). This monophyletic group is distributed in the northeast region of the Colorado River in the Edwards Plateau of central Texas. Little is understood about the habitat and egg deposition sites, but it is presumed that eggs may be deposited in gravelly substrates (Lannoo 2005). Adults have been only reported from spring outflows, gravel substrate, and under rocks. Currently, this species is a candidate for federal listing (http://ecos.fws.gov).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSASAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05190", "scientific_name": "Eurycea chisholmensis", "ITIS_TSN": "668290", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103095", "common_name": "Salado Salamander"}}
