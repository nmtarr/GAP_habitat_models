The occurrences of this species in Lousiana and Arkansas are considered to be disjunct from the main range (Ernst et al. 2003). Other studies have reported isolated populations of this snake in southwestern Wisconsin (Vogt 1981). In other words, the range of this species is mostly found west of the Mississippi River except for the reports in Wisconsin and Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe western wormsnake is found in a variety of habitats that include hardwood and conifer woodlands ,forests, and forest edges; wooded riparian surroundings and corridors (Collins 1993; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Johnson 2000; Trauth et al. 2004).\r\n\r\nUM\t-Hardwood forest, conifer and mixed woodland.
