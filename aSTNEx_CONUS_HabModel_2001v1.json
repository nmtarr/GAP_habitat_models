Adult newts are terrestrial, occupying forested environments in sandhill communities, longleaf pine forest, and pine flatwoods.   The efts wander, typical into high and mesophytic hammocks on well-drained soil, rosemary scrub, turkey oak, and high pine (Christman 1992; Mecham 1967).  They require a breeding habitat of isolated, ephemeral ponds, such as sinkholes, cypress or bay ponds, within sandhill and flatwoods communities (Ashton 1988).  They are rarely found with eastern newts.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSTNEx", "ELCode": "AAAAF01020", "scientific_name": "Notophthalmus perstriatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173618", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101322", "common_name": "Striped Newt"}}
