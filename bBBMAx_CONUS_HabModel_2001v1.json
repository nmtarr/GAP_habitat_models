This habitat is often linear along streams in West, and clumped in distribution, which in some cases can lead to near-colonial nest aggregations (Stone and Trost 1991)(quoted directly from Trost 1999).\r\nDuring non-breeding season, frequently numerous near human habitats\u2014e.g., livestock feedlots, barnyards, landfills, sewage lagoons, and grain elevators (Campbell et al. 1997). In habitats not influenced by humans, seeks riparian thickets, at least for roosting (quoted directly from Trost 1999).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nAll magpie habitat has an association of thickets or riparian areas for breeding with open meadows of grassland or sagebrush steppe suitable for its particular method of foraging (Bock and Lepthien 1975).  In winter in Colorado, this species can be found foraging in grassland-shrub dominated by Bromus spp., Poa  spp., Muhlenbergia spp., and Cercocarpus montanus, Rhus trilobata, and Chrysomthamnus spp (McKinstry and Knight 1993).  Can be found in association with white-tail prairie dog towns, and the principal vegetation type is sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) (Clark et al 1982).  In Utah, magpies were found to nest in small stands of trees and linear strips of riparian cover near agricultural fields or grassy shrublands (Reese and Kadlec 1985).  Found as a resident in Colfax County, New Mexico in grazed and ungrazed rangeland consisting of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma).  This species is common throughout the state of Nevada except in the southern part (Alcorn 1988).  This species lives in open country, including grasslands, and other open situations with scattered trees, shrubby areas, riparian and open woodland, forest edges and farmlands, in arid and humid habitats.  In Colorado, this species ranges statewide at all elevations from the plains throughout the mountains, and occasionally past timberline (Kingery 1998).  These birds frequent streamside thickets and scattered trees in open country and are also found in sagebrush, croplands, and pastures.  In summer in New Mexico this species is common in the northern part of the state, ranging from 5,000 to 10,500 feet (Ligon 1961). Currently, uncommon in Arizona (Phillips et al 1964). Generally not found above 2,200 m in Nevada (Ammon 2005). Occurs up to 3,963 m in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBBMAx", "ELCode": "ABPAV09010", "scientific_name": "Pica hudsonia", "ITIS_TSN": "726117", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104685", "common_name": "Black-billed Magpie"}}
