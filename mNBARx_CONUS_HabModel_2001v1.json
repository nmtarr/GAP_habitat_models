A guide to the mammals of the southeastern United States. University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville. xiv + 236 pp."}, "habitat_description": "Nine-banded Armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) are found throughout most of the southeastern coastal plain and may be rapidly expanding their range northward.  They also occur in most of Texas (Schmidley 1994).  In New Mexico two dead armadillos were observed about ten miles west of Santa Rosa, Guadalupe County, and shells and sightings were reported from Lea County (Findley et al. 1975).  They have been seen in Yuma, Prowers, and Baca counties in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).\r\n\r\nThis species\u2019 range is restricted by temperature in the north-central states because it isn\u2019t equipped to survive long periods of frigid weather (Schmidley 1994, Taulman and Robbins 2014).  Precipitation is likely the limiting factor to the west (Taulman and Robbins 2014\u00ac).  It may occupy a range in the desert country of the Pecos Valley but it is probably rare and sporadic (Findley et al. 1975). \r\n\r\nWithin areas with suitable climates, its distribution is largely determined by soils because it digs for food and to create dens (Schmidley 1994).  They prefer locations with moist, loose textured soil, and are rare in sites with heavy clay or rocky soil and waterlogged areas.  \r\n\r\nThey prefer both forested and semi-open habitats and are most common in areas with dense ground cover (Brown 1997).  Although they require access to water, they can be found some distance away from it.  In arid locations, they stay near streams and standing water, but they avoid marshy areas (Schmidley 1994).\r\n\r\nSuitable vegetative communities include grasslands, pinelands and hardwood uplands, lawns, flatwoods, coastal scrub, hardwood and mixed bottomlands (Cothran et al. 1991; Fernald 1989; Fitch, et al. 1952), woodlands, brushy areas, rock outcrops, cliffs, scrubby and brushy areas, savannas, forest edges (Burt and Grossenheider 1976, Choate et al. 1994). Burrows are dug under stumps, logs, bushes & brush piles, in stream banks, on hillsides and other places with adequate protective cover.  In the Edwards Plateau, They are most dense in stream bottoms where they nest in nearby rock outcrops (Schmidley 1994).  In the Texas Blacklands, they are rare and restricted to places near streams because the soils are heavy clay.\r\n\r\nIn general, armadillos inhabitating more mesic habitats (e.g. riparian floodplain) had smaller home ranges than those inhabiting grassland or open habitat (Taulman and Robbins 1996). Similarly, they are more dense in areas with friable soils and uncommon in hard-packed soils (Schmidley 1994).  N.
