Breeders usually settle near isolated trees or large shrubs and often perch on poles, wires or fence posts. This species nests in shrubs, small trees or vine covered plants (Yosef 1996, NatureServe 2010). Suitable hunting perches are an important part of the habitat (NatureServe 2010). Resident Loggerhead Shrikes use the same habitat all year. In many regions, loggerhead shrike abundance correlate with percentage of pastureland available (Yosef 1996). B.
