Populations occur nearby Saginaw Bay (Michigan) and Georgian Bay (Ontario); eastward of Lake Erie to Long Point Bay (Ontario) and along southern Lake Erie to Erie County, Ohio. This species also occurs in Pelee Island and some of the smaller Lake Erie islands (Conant 1938; 1940; 1951; Harding 1997).\r\n\r\nThe habitats associated with this species include riparian zones, herbaceous wetland, cropland, forest edge, hedgerow, various woodlands, grassland, old field, savanna, sand dunes, chaparral, and shrubland. This species commonly burrows in or using soil, fallen logs, and vegetative debris. Harding (1997) reported the habitat of this snake includes shoreline marshes and vegetated beaches and dunes of the Great Lakes. The author also described the movement of this species from the Great Lakes area to adjacent farm fields, woodlots, and pastures. This species is also reported to occupy rocky areas and open wooded areas on Lake Erie islands.\r\n\r\nUM\t-Found in herbaceous wetland, cropland, vegetated sand dunes and beaches, savanna, chaparral and shrubland.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEAFOx", "ELCode": "ARADB13061", "scientific_name": "Pantherophis gloydi", "ITIS_TSN": "683034", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105593", "common_name": "Eastern Foxsnake"}}
