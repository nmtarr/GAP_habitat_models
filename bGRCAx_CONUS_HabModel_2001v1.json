They are most abundant in shrub successional habitats and commonly found in damp areas (Cimprich & Moore 1995, Nicholson 1997).  They may, however, avoid dense forests and are generally uncommon in conifers but will be found in pine plantations (Cimprich & Moore 1995, GA-GAP 2003). \r\n\r\nGray Catbird nests are dense thickets, briars, vine tangles, shrubs, and low trees, typically 1-3 m above ground (Harrison 1979). \r\n\r\nIn the western U.S., Gray Catbirds occur at low elevation and in riparian thickets.  In the Southwest specifically, Gray Catbirds prefer dense shrublands, dense riparian thickets, and forested areas with thick undergrowth (Utah Conservation Data Center). A combination of dense vegetation and \"ledge\" situations are the ideal habitat for this species.  Coniferous forests are avoided but aspen groves are used (Johnsgard 1986, Andrews and Righter 1992).  \r\n\r\nWinter habitat is similar to breeding habitat but they are more closely associated with water, although not exclusively associated with it (Cimprich and Moore 1995).
