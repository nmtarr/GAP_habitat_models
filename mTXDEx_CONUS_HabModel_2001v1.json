The species has been described by some as semiarboreal (Choate et al. 1994, Schmidly 1994).  Several sources cite a strict association with rocky areas, bluffs, outcrops, ravines, and cliffs or Juniperus sp. or Blackjack Oak (Schmidly 1974, Reddin 2009).  Lack et al. (2010) described habitat as upland barren or rocky habitat in juniper and oak woodlands, mixed hardwood/pine forests, and cedar glades (Lack et al. 2010). Schmidely (1974) listed habitat associations as juniper-grass glades of Ozark Mountains, in Missouri; areas with blackjack oak, scrubby woodlands, and cliffs along tributaries of the Caney River in Chautauqua and Cowley counties in Kansas; forests along narrow steep-walled ravines in limestone with oak, black hickory, and elm in Oklahoma, and rocky cliffs with juniper cover in the Llano Estacado escarpment of Texas. Choate et al. (1994) listed habitat as mostly along rocky outcroppings and cliffs areas with cedar trees and grasses in shallow soils overlying rock in the Ozarks; and most often in open pine-oak hickory forest and woodlands on steep dry south-facing slopes and in areas near cedar trees in dry, rocky ravines or adjacent to shale beds of the Ouchitas.  Stancampiano and Schnell (2004) reported them in areas with tall herbaceous or woody canopies and barren or rocky grounds In Comanche County, Oklahoma.  Additionally, a survey in Cassatot River Arkansas found them to be associated with south-facing slopes regardless of substrate type or dominant canopy species (Reddin 2009).\r\n\r\nReddin (2009) studied the habitat associations of Texas Deermice at Pea Ridge National Military Park, Benton County, Arkansas, and his results contradicted the strict association with rocky areas, cliffs, and bluffs described by others.  He found Texas Deermice in areas up to a kilometer from rocky glades and cliffs and in forests dominated by a mix of oaks or Eastern Redcedar, as well as in old fields in smaller numbers than in forests. Captures in Post Oak forests were close to Eastern Redcedar dominated stands suggesting spill-over from cedar stands.  Most of the individuals that he captured were in cedar dominated stands.  They used areas with higher than average vertical vegetation structure and Eastern Redcedar basal area.  \r\n\r\nThis species is probably subordinate to Peromyscus leucopus in areas with they both occur.
