During the summer and fall their range expands with some individuals migrating long distances along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, while others remain near winter refuges (USFWS 2001).  Densities are much lower north of Georgia and west of the Suwannee River, and they are rare north of Cape Hatteras to Rhode Island (USFWS 2001).  One individual, \u201cChessie\u201d, has been documented migrating up the Atlantic Coast, as far as Rhode Island, several years between 1995 and 2011.   Large numbers of manatees have been known to stage in the northern Banana River and Indian River Lagoon, FL before dispersing in late spring.  12 to 15 manatees were documented inhabiting the Wakulla River, FL during consecutive summers (USFWS 2001).  Once water temperatures begin falling, they move to sources of warm water sources, such as natural springs and power plants (USFWS 2001).  Sightings west of FL drop off in October (USFWS) but individuals have been found in November far from FL (Mobile Bay, Mobile Bay-Tensaw Delta, Dog River, Fairhope, AL; Pascagoula River, MS; Chesapeake Bay, VA; and RI), but these are not believed to be safe places to be that late in the year due to cold weather.  During mild periods of winters, they move away from thermal refuges to grass beds in order to feed.  Individuals have been documented traveling up to 20 mi from thermal refuges during such periods (USFWS 2001).\r\n\r\nManatees inhabit fresh, brackish, and marine waters and can be found at almost any site in Florida with water levels and access channels of suitable depth (>1 or 2 m); this includes secluded canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons near the mouths of coastal rivers and sloughs (USFWS 2001).  They have been observed as much as 3.7 mi off the Florida Gulf Coast (http://www.fws.gov/nc-es/mammal/manatee.html).  They are primarily vegetarians that eat submerged, emergent, and floating vegetation, but will opportunistically eat some fish (USFWS 2001).  Typical habitats include coastal tidal rivers and streams, mangrove swamps, salt marshes, freshwater springs, and vegetated bottoms.  Mating activity can occur throughought the year, and calving is most frequent in spring but can occur any time of year. N.
