Forages in open areas over grassy pastures, plowed fields, etc\u2026(Brown and Brown 1999).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nOpen situations, less frequently in partly open habitats, frequently near water. Common breeder in Utah, where it prefers open habitats (UDWR 2003). Favors farmlands, open forests, rural and suburban areas. Presence of water for a mud source to build their nests is a key habitat factor. Breeds on structures, in open riparian, agricultural, and aquatic habitats and sometimes on cliffs and canyon walls. Breeds mostly in Upper Sonoran and Transition Zones (Phillips et al. 1964). Common summer resident in the valleys of the northern half of Nevada (Alcorn 1988).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBARSx", "ELCode": "ABPAU09030", "scientific_name": "Hirundo rustica", "ITIS_TSN": "178448", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104225", "common_name": "Barn Swallow"}}
