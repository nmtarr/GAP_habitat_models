More recently, this species has been found in Grapevine Cave and T Cave in Blanco County (Chippindale et al. 2000). Found in the Blanco River drainage off the Edwards Plateau (Green et al. 2013). This species has a patchy distribution and may be found in spring outflows. It is important to note that juveniles have been reported in shallow (<1cm) of water, while adults are completely aquatic and are only found near spring outflows, in the gravel substrate, and under rocks or leaves.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aFBSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05240", "scientific_name": "Eurycea pterophila", "ITIS_TSN": "208322", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102266", "common_name": "Fern Bank Salamander"}}
