On the Great Plains, most common in riparian situations with cottonwoods or in rank grasses and weeds along roadsides and irrigation ditches.  B. hylophaga may be more dependant on mesic environments (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Scarcity of short-tailed shrews in Colorado may be linked to aridity and lack of herbaceous cover in bottomlands of the South Platte and Republican River systems because of overgrazing by livestock (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Diet of B. hylophaga is similar to other species of Blarina, consisting primarily of animal matter, and small amounts of fungi and higher plants (Ritzi et al. 2005).  B. hylophaga seems to focus on hard-bodied food items including adult and larvae beetles (Ritzi et al. 2005).
