Highton (1972) suggests that this species was derived from isolated P. wehrlei stock.  They are usually found on north facing slopes above 810 meters, but have been found in Hampshire county West Virginia at an elevation of 732 meters (Pauley 1998, Mitchell and Pauley 2005).  They are associated with mixed deciduous forest interspersed with Virginia pine and hemlock and numerous rock outcrops (Green and Pauley 1987).  Also, mixed hardwood stands, hardwoods mixed with eastern hemlock, and hemlock stands, and moist areas in deep soil on north-facing slopes (Michell and Pauley 2005).  They are most abundant in high-elevation old-growth forests (including spruce-fir) (Wilson 1995) with many downed logs and in areas with an abundance of surface rocks (Mitchell 1991), including talus. Pine and young hardwood stands and clearcuts are avoided (Mitchell and Pauley 2005). They occur under rocks and logs or in burrows during the day.  This species is a terrestrial breeder.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCKSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12140", "scientific_name": "Plethodon punctatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173666", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104349", "common_name": "Cow Knob Salamander"}}
