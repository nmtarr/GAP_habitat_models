It is known to burrow in or using soil, ground litter, and fallen logs. In its range, this species can be found in open and semiopen areas, farmland, barnyards, pastures, prairies, weedy fields, sandhills, pine flatwoods, landward side of barrier beaches, marsh borders, rocky hillsides, thickets, open woodland, and residential areas (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Palmer and Braswell 1995; Werler and Dixon 2000). In general, this snake spends much time under surface cover or underground. Eggs are laid in an underground cavity (Behler and King 1979).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Uses soil, leaf litter, and fallen logs as cover. It inhabits heavily vegetated areas, but also open, sparsely vegetated zones.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rYBKIx", "ELCode": "ARADB19010", "scientific_name": "Lampropeltis calligaster", "ITIS_TSN": "174185", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101868", "common_name": "Yellow-bellied Kingsnake"}}
