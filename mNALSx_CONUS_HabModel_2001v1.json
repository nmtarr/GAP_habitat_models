They are also found in pinewoods with dense herbaceous cover and in forest openings of grassy, weedy, and brushy condition (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  They are not usually found in woods (Whitaker 1974).  This shrew can be found in the maritime forests and salt marshes of the coastal barrier islands (Webster et al. 1985).  In the southern part of their range, least shrews may be found in wooded habitats such as saw palmetto hammocks or managed stands of mature loblolly or shortleaf pine.  The determining factor may be presence of herbaceous ground cover, especially grasses (Cothran et al. 1991).  They may prefer drier sites, but are more tolerant of fluctuating water levels than B. brevicauda (Layne 1984).  In Tennessee, the home range for one female was 0.57 acre and was 0.41 acre for one male.  Nest site may be underground or under logs, stumps, rocks, and boards.  In Colorado, the least shrew inhabits a variety of habitats, occurring most often in grassy, weedy, or brushy areas that sometimes are quite dry (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  The least shrew has been trapped in shortgrass prairie, old fields, marshy areas, and riparian woodlands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Colorado is the western edge of this species distribution, occurring mainly along the South Platte and Republican drainages in northeastern Colorado, the Colorado Piedmont, and the northern Front Range of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  It is reported that soil is not important in determining presence or absence of C. parva but rather the presence of dense herbaceous ground cover, especially grasses (Whitaker 1974).  They breed March-November in the north and all year in south (mainly spring-summer). Gestation lasts about 2 weeks. Litter size is 2-7 (average 4-5) with two to three litters per year. The young are weaned in 3 weeks and are sexually mature after 5 weeks.
