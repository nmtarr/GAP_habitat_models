It is considered a separate species from the northern pocket gopher (T. talpoides) because the two do not interbreed in their small area of sympatry (Thaeler 1972).  Very little is know about the life history of this species (Patton 1999). Generally, the range of pocket gophers is limited by soil type and quality but some have a broad tolerance of soil conditions (Baker et al. 2003). Members of the Thomomys genus are typically found in rocky, gravelly soil but may occur in friable soil if no other pocket gophers are present (Baker et al. 2003). Where sympatric with T. talpoides, T. idahoensis occurs in more shallow, stony soil whereas T. talpoides occurs in deeper soil with few rocks (Thaeler 1972). However, there was not enough information available on possible soil restrictions of this species to justify including the soils layer in the model. Pocket gophers are found in a variety of open vegetation types, including grasslands and meadows (Baker et al. 2003). The Idaho pocket gopher occupies open sagebrush, grassland plains, and subalpine mountain meadows (Zeveloff 1988). Pocket gophers are found at medium to high elevations (Baker et al. 2003).  Specimens of T. idahoensis pygmaeus have been collected from 1417 - 2743 m in elevation in Utah and adjacent areas of Wyoming (Thaeler 1972). In Idaho, the Idaho pocket gopher is thought to occur in steppe, grasslands, and subalpine mountain meadows (Streubel 2000). They have been documented in open sagebrush, grassland plains, and subalpine mountain meadow habitats in Wyoming (WYNDD 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mIPGOx", "ELCode": "AMAFC01070", "scientific_name": "Thomomys idahoensis", "ITIS_TSN": "180225", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101241", "common_name": "Idaho Pocket Gopher"}}
