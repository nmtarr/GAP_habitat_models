Multi-species recovery plan for south Florida: Key Deer, Odocoileus virginiaus clavium. 1999.[http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/ListedSpeciesMSRP.html]"}, "habitat_description": "O. virginianus inhabits a variety of forests, shrublands, and grasslands (Smith, 1991). Across the species\u2019 range, it\u2019s distribution is restricted by proximity to both vegetative cover and foraging sites, which are broadly described as forest with complex structure and open grasslands/shrublands/croplands, respectively (Williamson and Hirth, 1985; Alverson et al., 1988; Dusek et al., 1989; Smith, 1991; Olson, 1992; Roseberry and Woolf, 1998; Hurley et al., 2012). Documented distances that individuals will travel from forest cover include: up to ~1000 m in cropland (Nixon et al., 1991); 500 m in cropland (Roseberry and Woolf, 1998); 250 m in pasture (Suring and Vohs, 1979); 300 m (Willms, 1971). Hiller (2007) found that white-tailed deer avoided agricultural lands at coarse scales but used it at finer scales, suggesting that only edges  are used; he provided additional support for this assertion by finding evidence of deer browsing only along the edge of large fields. Likewise, the species is rarely found in the interior of mature forest (Olson, 1992); Roseberry and Woolf (1998) found them to be restricted to 1 km from the forest edge, while Willms (1971) documented them as being restricted to distances of 120 m on north slopes and ~500 m on south slopes, with use peaking ~40 m from the forest edge. With the variety of literature on this topic, the Kansas GAP opted to apply a buffer distance of 2 km from forest when selecting suitable grasslands/croplands; the Southeast GAP applied a buffer of 125 m both into and out from forest edge.\r\n\r\nCover types within which white-tailed deer have been documented include: western Great Plains riparian forest (MacCracken and Uresk, 1984; Dusek et al., 1989); riparian woodlands (Peek, 1984; Omhart and Anderson, 1986; Fitzgerald et al., 1994; Ricca, 2000); aspen forest (Cairns and Tefler, 1980; Deperno et al., 2002); Black Hills spruce forest (Deperno et al., 2002); ponderosa pine forest and woodland (Deperno et al., 2002); longleaf pine forest (Thill and Martin, 1986; Brockway and Lewis, 2003); douglas-fir forest (Keay and Peek, 1980); lodgepole pine and douglas-fir forest (Pauley et al., 1993); western redcedar and western hemlock forest (Pauley et al., 1993); white cedar stands (Lesage et al., 2002; Jenkins, 2004); eastern hemlock forest (Witt, 2010); balsam fir forest (Jenkins, 2004); red pine woodlands (Jenkins, 2004); pinon-juniper woodlands (Martin et al., 1961; Ffolliott and DeBano, 2003); semi-arid oak woodlands (Anthony and Smith, 1977; Krausman et al ., 1978); semi-arid oak-juniper woodlands (Anthony and Smith, 1977); mesquite shrublands (Anthony and Smith, 1977; Brunjes et al., 2006); pine plantations (Adams, 1951); western oak woodlands (Smith, 1984; Ricca, 2000); conifer swamps (Felix et al., 2007); south Florida pine scrub and hammocks (Lopez et al., 2004b); Everglades tree islands of oak and palm (MacDonald-Beyers and Labisky, 2005); mangrove and buttonwood forests (Lopez et al., 2004b); hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood swamp (Hasapes, 2012); urban park woodlands (Grund et al., 2002) and more (see: Nixon et al., 1991; Smith, 1991; Hiller, 2007). \r\n\r\nOpen habitats, used primarily for foraging, within which white-tailed deer have been documented include: shrub meadows (Cairns and Telfer, 1980); agricultural fields (Watt et al., 1967; Kohn and Mooty, 1971; Gladfelter, 1984; Dusek et al., 1989; Nixon et al., 1991; Roseberry and Woolf, 1998); pasture (Suring and Vohs, 1979); mixed-grass prairie (Dusek et al., 1988; Sullivan et al., 1989; Kie and Bowyer, 1999; Volk et al., 2007); sotol grasslands (Krausman et al ., 1978); sand prairie (Steuter et al., 1995); tallgrass prairie (Watt et al., 1967; Finck et al., 1986); lawns in urban parks and in exurban/suburban residential areas (Grund et al., 2002; Storm et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2011); interior chaparral (Kie and Bowyer, 1999); Florida keys prairie and salt marsh (Lopez et al., 2004b); wet prairie (MacDonald-Beyers and Labisky, 2005); freshwater marsh (Lopez et al., 2004b); clearcut regeneration (Lesage et al., 2002); and burned forest (Willms, 1971).\r\n\r\nIn addition to avoiding large open expanses and dense interior forest (Fitzgerald et al., 1994), white-tailed deer specifically avoid: bare rock/sand/clay and quarries (Miranda and Porter, 2003) and commercial developed areas (Grund et al., 2002; Miranda and Porter, 2003; Hiller, 2007). Furthermore, they have not been documented in sagebrush or other arid/semi-arid shrublands (MacCracken and Uresk, 1984; Olson, 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWTDEc", "ELCode": "AMALC02021", "scientific_name": "Odocoileus virginianus clavium", "ITIS_TSN": "202409", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101467", "common_name": "Key Deer"}}
