The largest breeding population in the entire range may be supported in the bottomlands of the Upper Mississippi River near Kellogg in Wabasha County in Minnesota (Kofron and Schreiber 1985, McCoy 1973).\r\n\r\nThe species prefers prairie marshes in the western and southern parts of its range (Bleakney 1958).The species was more widespread on the central prairies of Illinois, Iowa, and Kansas before the extensive wet prairie marshes were drained. Remains are common in archeological sites throughout the present range of the species (McCoy 1973). Eggs are tolerant of dry conditions and relatively high temperatures (Gutzke and Packard 1987). However, Emydoidea blandingii has a very low maximum temperature tolerance (mean = 39.5 C, range 38.2 to 40.6 C) which restricts the turtle's range, and the egg adaptations allow the turtle to use dry, exposed nesting sites (Hutchison et al. 1966). \r\n\r\nIn general , suitable habitats for the Blanding\u2019s turtle include marshes, ponds, swamps, lake shallows, backwater sloughs, shallow slow-moving rivers, protected coves and inlets of large lakes, oxbows, and pools adjacent to rivers; waters with soft bottom and aquatic vegetation (Ernst et al. 1994; Kofron and Schreiber 1985; Nyboer 1992). \r\n\r\nHibernation most often occurs within organic substrate of ponds and creeks (Ross and Anderson 1990). Blanding\u2019s turtles somewhat communal hibernation may be due to scarcity of suitable hibernation sites. Most moved from marshes, shallow ponds, and ditches to deeper ponds after September 1. The deeper ponds probably provide stable water levels during the critical overwintering period and a longer period of warm water temperatures in early fall. Individuals in Missouri hibernated in shallow marsh areas under 15 cm mud below 9.5-21 cm of water (Congdon et al. 1983). Eggs are laid usually in sandy soil in upland areas, usually in warm sunny sites (Congdon et al. 1983). Blanding\u2019s turtles probably nest on available clearings, on sand and gravel bars, and on muskrat lodges or beaver lodges and dams prior to the modification of the landscape by humans (Petokas 1986). Prairie marsh or wet prairie, especially associated with sandy soils, is the preferred habitat in the western part of the range, (Kofron and Schreiber 1985, Nyboer 1992). The primary indicator of juvenile and subadult habitat appears to be Sphagnum (McMaster and Herman 2000). According to McNeil et al. (2000), hatchlings do not seek open water upon emergence from the nest.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rBTURx", "ELCode": "ARAAD04010", "scientific_name": "Emydoidea blandingii", "ITIS_TSN": "173789", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100408", "common_name": "Blanding's Turtle"}}
