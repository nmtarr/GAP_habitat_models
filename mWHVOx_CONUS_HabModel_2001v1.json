Generally, habitat includes open coniferous forest with a shrub understory, mossy meadows in forests and alpine tundra with cover (Natureserve). Heather voles occupy stands of spruce, fir, lodgepole, aspen, and ponderosa pine, and grassy meadows in montane forests, subalpine forests, and alpine tundra (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). This species is commonly associated with spruce and lodgepole forests with ground cover of Vaccinium, such areas frequently occur on glacial moraines (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Colorado, they are mostly found in moist to seasonally dry areas close to water (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Utah, they are only known from the high Unita and Wasatch Mountaitns (Durrant 1952). Known from New Mexico only from Sangre de Cristo and San Juan Mountains, mainly at high altitudes (Findley et al. 1975). Heather voles are active year-round (Fitzgerald 199). In summer, they live in shallow burrow systems usually less than 20 cm deep (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In winter, nests reportedly have thicker walls and are better insolated; winter nests can be under snow located on the surface of the ground in protected areas under shrubs, dead timber, or rock overhangs (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Heather vole distribution is known from scattered records (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Elevations from captures animals range from 2,100 feet to above timberline (4,420m) (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Heather voles have been found at 3,630m in the Colorado Sangre de Cristos (Findley et al. 1975). Specimens in Utah have been collected at 2,700m to 3,150m (Durrant 1952). This species occupies mountainous regions typically near or above timberline at elevations between 1400 and 3690 meters although in Washington and Oregon they have been observed as low as 755 meters (Willson and Ruff 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWHVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF10010", "scientific_name": "Phenacomys intermedius", "ITIS_TSN": "180359", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105193", "common_name": "Western Heather Vole"}}
