Breeds in streamside habitats and forest edges (Utah Conservation Data Center 2001). Dense shrubby habitats preferred (NatureServe Explorer 2004). Uses coniferous forest undergrowth and edge, brushy hillsides, riparian thickets, and chapparal (NatureServe Explorer 2004). In montane habitats of Colorado, associated with riparian aspen-willow and spruce aspen communities (NatureServe Explorer 2004). Restricted to forested mountains in Nevada (Alcorn 1988). Breeds in foothill and montane riparian shrublands and aspen forests with shrubby understories and sometimes in Gambel oak (Andrews and Righter 1992). Associated with brushy thickets, especially riparian woodlands (Johnsgard 1986). Less often it occurs in dense deciduous woods or mixed woodlands on upland slopes or in montane river-bottom forests (Johnsgard 1986). Prefers dense low brush (Phillips et al. 1964). Mountain carrs, mountain shrublands, riparian deciduous and scrub oaks (Kingery 1998). Prefers large shrubs found at the interface between steep slopes and riparian/moist areas (Kingery 1998). MacGillivray's warblers are generally seen within, or in proximity to, relatively mesic woodland habitats characterized by stands of salt-cedar and Russian olive (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Breeds from the base of the foothills to 3,354 m in Colorado (Kingery 1998). Occurs at 910 to 3960 m in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Macgillivray's warbler is less common and\r\nmore local as a breeder in mountains south of Sierra Nevada. A common migrant in southern\r\ninterior and less common coastally. Less abundant in interior and more abundant coastally in\r\nnorth. An uncommon to fairly common migrant on Farallon and Channel Islands (DeSante\r\nand Ainley 1980, Garrett and Dunn 1981)(quoted directly from Green et al. taken from Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nMacGillivray\u2019s Warbler breeds commonly in riparian habitat and clearcuts of northern coniferous forests along the Rocky Mountains. Breeds at low to moderate elevations, up to 3,000 m (Oakleaf 1992), primarily in coniferous-forest clearcuts with spruce and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga) or mixed deciduous forests with birch (Betula) and aspen and poplar (Populus) in Canada and n. U.S. (Fig. 2) Common in riparian habitats and wet thickets in southern portion of breeding range. Requires dense undergrowth and moderate cover (Morrison and Meslow 1983). Amount of cover is important for assessing breeding habitat in coniferous and deciduous forests.\r\nIn California, this species is an uncommon to common, summer resident of dense brush in moist habitats. Frequents valley foothill riparian, coastal Douglas-fir and redwood, montane riparian, and, in migration,desert riparian habitats. Breeds in interior mountains up to about 2800 m (9000 ft) in the south (Garrett and Dunn 1981), and to 2400 m (8000 ft) in the north (Gaines 1977b). Also breeds coastally from Monterey Co. north (McCaskie et al. 1979, 1988)(quoted directly from Green et al. taken from Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bMGWAx", "ELCode": "ABPBX11040", "scientific_name": "Oporornis tolmiei", "ITIS_TSN": "178940", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101590", "common_name": "Macgillivray's Warbler"}}
