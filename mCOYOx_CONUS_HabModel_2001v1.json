They are most abundant in grasslands, less abundant in dense coniferous fores. Found almost everywhere in the NV, NM, AZ, CO, UT. Coyotes survive in a diversity of environments and recently have become common in many urban areas. Throughout New Mexico, from the deserts and desert slopes to spruce fir of higher mountains. Broken country, interrupted by rocks, brush, clumps of pinyon juniper or other vegetation, makes excellent habitat for coyotes. The species is often found in close proximity to farms, ranches, and suburan areas. Most common in grasslands, are found in all habitats in New Mexico. Coyotes occur from high mountains to low deserts.  They are often common on rangelands and in the suburbs of towns and cities.  Coyotes occur at all elevations and in all ecosystems (Fitzgerald et al 1994).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Oregon, this species occurs in habitats ranging from grasslands to shrub-steppe to boreal forests and within remote wilderness or urbanized areas (Voigt and Berg 1987). Young (1951) considered the coyote and edge species because it had (at that time) extended its range to regions such as northwestern Oregon where broad expanses of mature forest had been removed through logging or fire (Verts and Carraway 1998).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nPerhaps introduced by fox hunters or arrived as the result of natural eastward expansion from its western and central North America range, the coyote is now believed to be well established in most eastern states (Lee et al. 1982).  Coyotes are habitat generalists and feed on meso and small mammals, reptiles,  birds and small livestock; they also scavenge.  They are limited by food availability as opposed to habita type.  However they do respond to human landscape features.  Home ranges are smaller in urban areas and movement rates are much lower compared to rural areas.  They tended to avoid urban areas and agricultural fields  (Atwood et al. 2004).  The coyote is capable of inhabiting any area perhaps with the exception of areas densely populated by humans (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Will inhabit a wide range of habitats from open to forested conditions. However, they appear to be most suited to scrub country, fragmented forest and landscapes with a diversity of habitats (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). In Georgia, coyotes demonstrated habitat selection only during night hours. Brushy areas, young pine, pine/hardwoods, bottomland hardwoods receive most use (ranking 1 to 3 respectively) were used more than expected during nocturnal hours; pastures, agricultural, mature pine plantations were used less (Holzman et al 1992). In Texas habitats were used that  supported the highest prey densitites. Preferred habitats were savannah and prairie creeks. High prey densities, abundant fruit, and the opportunistic feeding strategy of coyotes apparently minimized habitat selection (Bradley & Fagre 1988).  Prefer open rangeland, fallow fields, and brushy pastures.  Least common in deep forest areas (Brown 1997).  Giordano and Pace (2000) studied coyotes in a marsh system in Louisiana.  They den in swamps as well.\r\nDenning and young rearing typically occurs in a subterranean chamber located in a brushy-thicketed area, in a ravine or gully, or among rocks and boulders (Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Woodlands and agricultural areas were used more than expected by transient coyotes, whereas grasslands were used more than expected by family groups in Kansas (Kamler and Gipson 2000).\r\nIn Maine, mean home range was 46.4 square km  and dispersal of 300+ km documented (Harrison et al 1989).  The average dispersal distance was 102 km (Harrison 1992). In Vermont, the mean home range was 16.4 square km using the convex polygon, 17.7  square km using the harmonic mean.  In Yellowstone, the mean recovery distance of 102 females was 11.1 miles and of 110 males was 7.9 miles. The maximum distance travelled was by a female with pups for 115 airline miles (Robinson & Grand).  In Texas, using radio telemetry, the mean home range size of resident individuals was 3.04 square km. For males the mean home range was 3.07 +/- 0.77 sqare km, for females the mean home range was 3.01 +/- 0.22 square km. One adult male dispersed 3 km. One adult female dispersed 13 km. In Georgia average female home range size was 34 km2 and adult male average home range size was not reported. Juvenile males in Georgia had home ranges sizes averaging 5.9 km2 (Holzman 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCOYOx", "ELCode": "AMAJA01010", "scientific_name": "Canis latrans", "ITIS_TSN": "180599", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102680", "common_name": "Coyote"}}
