It occurs on Sutil Island, 1.3 Kilometers offshore from Santa Barbara Island, but larger numbers are found on San Clemente and Santa Barbara Islands. San Clemente Island being the largest inhabited island (Bezy et al. 1980). In San Clemente Island, its elevational range occurs from near sea level to 610 meters (Jones and Lovich 2009). Stebbins (2003) has reported grassland, chaparral, shrubland, to characterize the habitat occupied by this species. It can be found nearby clumps of cactus and boxthorn, and also in the vicinity of sandy to rocky streambeds, cliffs and beaches.\r\n\r\nOther authors have described this species to prefer areas of low-lying and thick vegetation. It is commonly spotted in patches of prickly pear, boxthorn, and thickets of non-native Australian saltbush (Fellers and Drost 1991; Matthews and Moseley 1990). This species is known to find refuge under rocks, fallen branches, and driftwood (Stebbins 2003), but also reported to burrow in its habitat mainly characterized by rocky soils (Fellers and Drost 1991; Matthews and Moseley 1990).\r\n\r\nFound in clumps of cactus (prickly pear), thickets of boxthorn, and patches of non-native Australian saltbush.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rINLIx", "ELCode": "ARACK01020", "scientific_name": "Xantusia riversiana", "ITIS_TSN": "174091", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106467", "common_name": "Island Night Lizard"}}
