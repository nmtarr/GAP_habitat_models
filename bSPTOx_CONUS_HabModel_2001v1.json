It occurs in the northern Great Plains, middle elevations of mountains and intermountain plateaus, and Pacific coastal lowlands and offshore islands (Greenlaw 1996).\r\n\r\nBreeding habitat is characterized by \u201cdense, broadleaf shrubby growth only a few meters tall with or without emergent trees that provide deep, sheltered, semishaded litter and humus on the ground with screens of twigs and foliage close overhead\u201d (Greenlaw 1996).  In the west, these habitats lie above the desert and below subalpine conifer forest (Greenlaw 1996).  In Colorado, they prefer scrub oak, shrubby pinyon-juniper woodlands, and riparian thickets (Kingery 1998).  They are found in pinyon-juniper habitat in northeastern New Mexico (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma).  In Arizona, this species is a common summer resident in dense broad-leaved brush of the Upper Sonoran Zone (Phillips et al. 1964).  Birds in the Great Plains utilize shrubby thickets in riparian areas and woodland underbrush (Greenlaw 1996).  They occupy chaparral in Californian coastal ranges and rose-blackberry (Rosa-Rubus) thickets in mesic bottomlands near the ocean (Greenlaw 1996).  Some plants commonly associated with the species are: scrub oaks, pinon pine, juniper, yucca, baccharis, willow, senecio, madrone, rose, blackberry, saltbush, mountain-mahogany, toyon, elder, buckthorn, sage, snowberry, chamise, manzanita, sumac, ceanothus, and grape (Greenlaw 1996). \r\n\r\nSpotted Towhees usually occur between 760 and 1830 m in Idaho and 6000 to 8000 feet (1828-2438 m) in New Mexico (Ligon 1961).\r\n\r\nWinter habitat is shrubs and thickets, including mesquite thickets in Arizona lowlands and shrubs at the perimeters of marshes along the Colorado River Valley even though they don\u2019t breed there.
