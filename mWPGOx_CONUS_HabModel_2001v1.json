However, the taxonomy of this species is somewhat uncertain as some have found evidence for lumping some of the subspecies (USFWS 2007, NatureServe 2014).  These gophers exist in open prairie-like communities in Washington and Oregon states where they are somewhat rare with a patchy distribution of isolated populations.  They are associated with glacial outwash prairies and their distribution is limited by suitable vegetative cover and soils (Verts and Carraway 2000).  Suitable sites in Washington were Carstairs, Nisqually, or Spanaway gravelly or sandy loam soil (USFWS 2007).  Prairies south of the Puget Sound, Washington with black silt and gravel soil are suitable (Verts and Carraway 2000).  West of the Coast Range and along the Pacific Coast, they occurred in pastures and fallow fields with silt loam or sandy loam soils (Verts and Carraway 2000).  In southern Oregon, they inhabit meadows and other open areas within parklike and ponderosa pine dominated regions (Verts and Carraway 2000).  Recently logged Douglas-fir \u2013 white fir and mixed-coniferous stands replanted to ponderosa pine have been known to support populations (Verts and Carraway 2000) and populations have been documented in Eastern Oregon in annual grass, perennial grass, and forb communities (Verts and Carraway 2000).  The T. m. melanops subspecies is restricted to subalpine and alpine meadows in the Olympic Mountains (USFWS 2007).  These gophers have also been found in orchards with mowed grass and forb understory, Christmas tree plantations with orchard grass understory, regenerating clearcuts, hay grass, pasture, nurseries, and market crop fields (Verts and Carraway 2000, Cook 2014).  Populations are known to occur at the Olympia and Shelton Airports and Fort Lewis (USFWS 2007). N.
