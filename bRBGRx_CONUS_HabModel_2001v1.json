In the United States, they occur in a wide variety of deciduous and mixed wooded upland and lowland habitats and will not inhabit grasslands (Wyatt and Francis 2002).  They are found in second growth (Ehrlich et al. 1988), medium, or mature deciduous forests (Simpson 1992) with a medium to dense understory (Nicholson 1997), or wherever there is a dense growth of trees and shrubs along the margin of forests, marshes, roads, pastures, or streams (Bent 1968).  They have also been known to nest in heath balds and abandoned strip mines (Nicholson 1997).  Well-vegetated suburban areas, parks, gardens and orchards are also suitable (Wyatt and Francis 2002).  They are rarely found in coniferous forests or closed canopy forests (Wyatt and Francis 2002).  \r\n\r\nRose-breasted Grosbeaks \u2018prefer mesic woodlands, swamp forests, and riparian corridors and avoid dry oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands' (Wyatt and Francis 2002).  They are not sensitive to patch size (Wyatt and Francis 2002).\r\n\r\nIn the southern Appalachians, Rose-breasted Grosbeaks only breed above 640 m in elevation and usually at elevations above 900 m in Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina.
