It\u2019s distribution is based on primarily soils and then vegetation and interspecific competitions with Geomys and Thomomys species (Texas Tech 1997).\r\n\r\nC. castanops likes the rich soils of river valleys and streams, agricultural land, and meadows (Natureserve 2001) but will occupy heavier soils on uplands if it's displaced by Geomys (Thompson et al. 1996).  It is partial to deep, mellow soils relatively free from rocks, as found between sands along rivers and rocky, shallow soils of mountains (Texas Tech 1997).  In Kansas it is found in deep, upland soils and in roadside ditches having loamy soils and calcareous deposits (Natureserve 2001). It generally avoids the hard soils of upper slopes (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The minimum soil depth required for C. castanops is 175 cm (Davidow-Henry et al. 1989). Burrows are more common in disturbed areas than in open climax pastureland (Best 1973).  \r\n\r\nThe species occurs in midgrass and tallgrass prairie, desert grassland, shortgrass steppe, lowland riparian habitats, well-kept lawns, and golfcourses (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). \r\nIt is also found among mesquite-creosotebush, oak mountain scrub, sand scrub, Great Basin sagebrush and rabbitbrush, tarbush, ocotillo, grama and buffalograss, sideoats and wheatgrass, big bluestem, sand bluestem, tobosa, sacaton, and cottonwood and sycamore riparian vegetation (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  In Texas the species is a generalist and able to survive in many habitats (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s favorite foods are clovers and related plants, although the species will consume whatever is available (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Bailey 1971). The home range is about 0.13 ha for females, 0.22 for males (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Bailey 1971). Maximum slope is 6 degrees (Best 1973). In parts of southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico, C. castanops is apparently being replaced by Geomys, perhaps due to habitat disturbance (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). C. castanops is more mobile than other gopher species, but may be more limited by water barriers than other species (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). SWreGAP & N.
