It breeds in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains but is not found in deserts.  This species is a fairly common summer resident over most of Nevada, and is seen frequently along streams (Alcorn 1988).  \r\n\r\nThis species is generally observed in brushy, early-succesional habitats: \u201carid bushy hillsides, riparian habitats, wooded valleys, aspen (Populus), willow (Salix), alder (Alnus), or cottonwood (Populus) thickets, sagebrush (Artemisia), chaparral, open scrub, recent postfire habitats, thickets and hedges along agricultural fields, and residential gardens\u201d (Greene et al. 1996).  They will also breed in recently disturbed sites, such as burned areas, where shrubby growth has established itself (Greene 1996).  In the lower Colorado River Valley, this species occurs in open or burned riparian woodland, agricultural margins, citrus orchards, and other brush (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In California, open chaparral; shrubby understories of open, wooded habitats; valley foothill riparian habitats; willow thickets; vine tangles; and patches of tall forbs are used (Zeiner et al. 1990).  Areas with and without a tree canopy can be suitable, but the canopy must be open.\r\n\r\nForaging habitat includes grasses, forbs, shrubs, aspen, cottonwood, and willow in riparian thickets and woodlands (Greene 1996).  \r\n\r\nLazuli Buntings are summer residents in Arizona, in willow associations of the Sonoran zones (central and NE Arizona) (Monson and Phillips 1981), and also prefer willows in New Mexico (Ligon 1961).  They are summer residents of the Sandia Mountains in New Mexico (Tatschl 1967).  \r\n\r\nThis species may be an indicator species for habitat degradation in riparian forested areas of the Toiyabe mountain range in central Nevada, in particular, birch and willow (Warkentin and Reed 1999).  \r\n\r\nThe general elevation limit reported for this species is 3000 m (Greene et al. 1996).  In Colorado, this bird is found mostly in shrubs in the Transition Zone, from 1675-2135 m, especially in riparian areas (Kingery 1988).  It is a summer resident in Utah occupying streamside shrubbery and mountain brush lands up to 2744 m (Hayward et al. 1976).  In California, postbreeding movements to areas at 3050 m have been reported (Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nLazuli Buntings winter in Mexico and portions of Arizona in open and semi open areas of thorn forest, hedgerows, fallow fields, plantations, and field and road edges.
