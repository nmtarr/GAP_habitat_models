Found in grassy areas near water and also higher sand desert areas (Hall 1995). In Utah it occurs in desert, meadows, and the mouths of some of the canyons (Durrant 1952). Found in cottonwood-willow, western live oak, grama \"short-grass\", juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, sycamore, shinnery oak sandscrub, emory oak, gray oak, sand sage, winter-fat, creosotebush, sagebrush, mesquite, tarbush, ocotillo, sand bluestem, big bluestem, alkali sacaton, tobosa, tumbleweeds, sycamore, cattails, and Apache plume (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Found in sumac-grama, mesquite-grass plains, salt-cedar-groundsel-three-awn associations (Caire et al. 1989). Mainly found in human-inhabited areas (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). At times house mice live far from water in desert conditions (Hall 1995). The species is likely found throughout Arizona in or near towns, but absent from desert regions (Hoffmeister 1986). M. musculus probably lives in all major cities and towns in Colorado as well as the adjacent farmlands, ranchlands, and \"waste\" areas (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species is distributed throughout the state (Hall 1995). It occurs statewide in New Mexico usually at lower elevations and in or near urban areas (Frey 2004). In Utah it occurs statewide (Durrant 1952). The range was created using Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Hall 1995, Frey 2004, and Utah GAP 1997. (Water is required in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). House mice are more dependent on water than many native rodents in Arizona- must be a limiting factor in many places (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Elevation is 152-2,439m (Hall 1995, Thompson et al. 1996). Home range is 0.17 (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nHouse mice were introduced from Europe and Asia, and are now ubiquitous throughout the United States. Although strongly associated with human habitats, they may also survive in the wild in fields, pastures, fencerows, weedy roadsides and sometimes even in wooded environments. In Florida they are found in glades, willow heads, clearings in hammock, dry fresh marsh, herbaceous vegetation, fields, and cabbage palm hammock (Layne 1984), beach dunes, sea oats, barrier islands, and dunes (Humphrey and Barbour 1981). They mayalso be found in coastal scrub (Fernald 1989) and grassy sand dunes along the coast (Webster et al. 1985). Elsewhere, prefers disturbed situations with rank weedy growth, as on silty soil at old margin, and among roadside weeds.  \r\nNests in small chambers in any secluded location within buildings or in ground burrows (Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). In some areas, movement into buildings coincides with the onset of cold weather in late fall.  Average movements were 73.6 feet.  Minimum home range of an adult male is 0.44 acre (Fitch 1958). In Tennessee, home range for 1 juvenile in a grassy habitat was 0.30 acres.  Estimated density was 2.5/acre (Howell 1954). # Edificarian and open fields.  At Savannah River, densities were approximately 5/ha in old field situations (Cothran et al. 1991).\r\nThe elevational limit is from Smoky Mountians National Park (http://www.discoverlife.org/nh/tx/Vertebrata/Mammalia/Muridae/Mus/musculus/images/Mus_musculus_map.GSMNP.640.jpg)\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nCalifornia WHR describes habitat in California: \"The introduced house mouse is common throughout California near human habitation in urban habitats, and less common in a variety of natural communities. Found in buildings, fields and croplands, disturbed herbaceous habitats, and to a lesser extent in various forest and shrub habitats. Abundant to common near human habitation and in riparian habitats. Generally absent from higher elevations.\" [Brylski et al. 2005 based on (Zeiner et al. 1990)]. In Oregon, Verts and Carrway (1998) describe habitat as being entirely dependent on proximity to human dwellings including any mention of locations from fields or grasslands stating \"Wes suspect that most populations in open fields in Oregon are temporary, near human structures, and limited to warmer and drier seasons.\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mHOMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF22010", "scientific_name": "Mus musculus", "ITIS_TSN": "180366", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106007", "common_name": "House Mouse"}}
