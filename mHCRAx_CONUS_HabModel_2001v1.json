In Arizona, this species is patchily distributed (Hoffmeister 1986). There are two main areas where this species is distributed: (1) southwestern Yuma County to the west and (2) southwestern Gila, eastern Graham, southern Greenlee and northeastern Cochise counties to the east (Hoffmeister 1986). Historically, Allen (1895) reports this species was recorded by Price only around Fairbank (n = 12 collected individuals). Goldman (1918) identified two subspecies: (1) S.h. confines occurred in the upper portions of the Gila River valley and (2) S.h. jacksoni occurred in the plateau region near Prescott. In the Huachuca Mountains, this species was recorded at the mouth of Miller Canyon (n = 6), mouth of Ramsey Canyon (n = 2), along the road between the mouths of Ramsey and Carr Canyons (n = 2), nine miles west of Hereford (n = 7) and the mouth of Montezuma Canyon (n = 1; Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954). On the Verde and Salt Rivers, approximately 25 miles northeast of Phoenix, this species was captured in mesquite during the August 1975 only at (0.4 captures/270 trap nights) for that month and (<0.1 captures/ 270 trap nights) for the overall 13-month trapping period (Stampand Ohmart 1976). In Colorado, the range of this species is believed to be expanding into southwestern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It has been documented in Baca (Lechleitner 1969; Fitzgerald et al. 1994), Fremont, Otero, Pueblo, (Fitzgerald et al. 1994) and Kiowa County (Lechleitner 1969). It has been expanding up the Arkansas River and its tributaries (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Nevada, this cotton rat occurs in the extreme southern portion of the state in the bottomlands of the Colorado River (Hall 1946). In New Mexico, it has been identified in Chaves, Curry, DeBaca, Dona Ana, Eddy, Grant, Guadalupe, Harding, Hidalgo, Lincoln, Luna, Otero, Quay, Roosevelt, San Miguel, Sierra, Socorro, Union and Valencia Counties (Findley et al. 1975). In the Animas Mountains, this rat was identified as the \u201cmost common\u201d species (Cook 1986). This species has been trapped in the Alamo Hueco, Big Hatchet and Sierra Rica Mountains, Hidalgo County, New Mexico (Hayward et al. 1978).\r\nMohlhenrich (1961) concluded this species does not require a source of free water, while in Colorado, Anderson  (1972) identified this rat as occurring near streams and reservoirs and Fitzgerald et al. (1994) suggest it selects for \u201cmoist sites\u201d when available. Allen (1895) found this cotton rat to be \u201ccommon in swampy localities along the San Pedro River at Fairbank,\u201d and Grinnell (1914) suggest it is \u201cstrictly riparian in its associational preferences.\u201d  In Nevada, Hall (1946) indicates this cotton rat occurs just above the water level and may construct runways through water up to one inch deep. Of all these references, only Mohlhenrich (1961) suggests this species does not require standing water. However, he does not suggest it doesn\u2019t occur at proximity to water or riparian zones. The other five authors all suggest this species requires moist sites.  Thus, it seems to require at least moist areas. In New Mexico, S. hispidus is occurred within cottonwood, joint-fir and cattail (Mohlhenrich 1961).  This cotton rat occurs in midgrass to tallgrass prairie, and weedy areas in riparian zones (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  In Colorado, Fitzgerald et al. (1994) suggest \u201cgood canopy cover\u201d is required for this species. The three riparian systems listed below contain Populus fremontii, while the first system contains both Populus fremontii and Picea pungens. These ecological systems also occur within the known range of this species.  Therefore, inclusion of these systems is justified. This species is expected to occur year round within these systems where suitable habitat is present.\r\nIn California, this species has become established (presumably through agricultural irrigation practices) along the Colorado River and the Imperial Valley (Dixon 1922). It occupies grass and cropland habitats adjacent to water, early successional grass-forb understories, and overgrown clearings with herbaceous borders of fields and brush. Tall dense grasses are preferred. (Fleharty and Mares 1973, Kaufman and Fleharty 1974, McClenaghan and Gaines 1978, Hall and Dalquest 1963, [Brylski et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nHispid cotton rats are found in open and semi-open habitats with sufficient cover to provide security from predation. They may be abundant in old fields with broomsedges and other grasses, in marshes, and in thickets and other habitats with dense growth of honeysuckle or blackberries.  They are often the most common small rodent of open farm and old field habitats in the southeastern United States (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Watery habitats containing emergent grasses, reeds and sedges are also suitable for the cotton rat (Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). They are also found in pine-palmetto stands and dense cord grass, pinelands, flatwoods, hammocks, and transition areas, beaches [sea oats/agave], patches of shrubs in salt marshes and prairies, buttonwood, swamp, willowhead, sawgrass marsh, moist grassland, freshwater and salt prairie, ditches, canal banks, and sugarcane (Lazell 1989; Fernald 1989; Barbour and Humphrey 1982; Lefebvre 1982; Layne 1974). Estimated density is 7.6/acre (Howell 1954). They tend towards drier habitats in wet seasons (Layne 1984). Shallow tunnel systems are used for nesting & food storage and nests are typically built under logs, rocks.  Their home range averages 0.35 ha (Cameron and Spencer 1981). They breed throughout the year, with peak activity in the spring and fall.  Severe cold may curtail reproduction in winter.  Gestation lasts 27 days. Litter size averages about 5-7 with several litters per year. They reach sexual maturity in 2-3 months and are short-lived, in Oklahoma hardly any lived 6 months (Caire et al. 1989).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, hispid cotton rats generally inhabit tall grasses of Andropogon, Sparina, and Carex species. However, in western portions of the state with little to no grassy habitat, the species utilizes dens at the base of mesquite clumps. Other environments include old fields, prairie, powerline, rail and road easements, and dense riparian woodlands containing thick grasses (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mHCRAx", "ELCode": "AMAFF07010", "scientific_name": "Sigmodon hispidus", "ITIS_TSN": "180349", "Global_SEQ_ID": "799832", "common_name": "Hispid Cotton Rat"}}
