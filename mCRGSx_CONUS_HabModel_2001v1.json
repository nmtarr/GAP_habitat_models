It occurs in desert and grassland sites that provide a humid microclimate, such as boulder fields or marshy areas along the Rio Grande (Findley 1987). The species is found in semi-arid grassland with scattered cactus and yucca, shortgrass plains, sacaton grasslands, desert scrub, chaparral slopes, oak savannah and woodland, juniper woodland, alluvial fans, sagebrush, gullies, riparian associations, agriculture, and cattail marshes (Armstrong and Jones, Jr. 1972, Thompson et al. 1996, NatureServe 2004, Davis and Schmidly 1997). N. crawfordi occurs in cottonwood-willow, pinyon-juniper, Apache pine, Chihuahuan pine, ponderosa pine, western live oak, Gambel's oak, bluestem, alkali sacaton, tobosa, grama, buffalograss, sycamore, rabbitbrush, winter-fat, sagebrush, creosote, mesquite, agave, and Mexican Mormon tea (Armstrong and Jones, Jr. 1972, Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, NatureServe 2004, Hall 1995). It was captured in a saltbush-saltcedar-redgrass slough in Nevada, and in a riparian forest of oak, cottonwood, sycamore, walnut and juniper in Arizona (Armstrong and Jones, Jr. 1972). It has been taken from dry, rocky areas (Armstrong and Jones, Jr. 1972). A safe place to nest and rest is probably more important than plant association (Hoffmeister 1986). It can survive without free water but will drink it when available (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). N. crawfordi can tolerate higher temperatures than other shrews (Thompson et al. 1996). N. crawfordi is often reported to occupy woodrat dens, especially Neotoma micropus and Neotoma albigula (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). \r\nN. crawfordi occurs throughout Arizona in arid habitat with sufficient cover (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in southeastern, southwestern, and west-central Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is present in southwestern Nevada (Armstrong and Jones, Jr. 1972). The species occurs throughout New Mexico at lower elevations (Frey 2004). It is present along the southern border of Utah (Utah GAP 1997).  It can be found in the following mountain ranges: Animas Mountains; Chiricahua Mountains; Huachuca Mountains; Caballo Mountains; San Andres Mountains.  In southern California, down to sea level and prefers desert washes, desert srub, desert riparian areas, mixed chaparral, and pinyon-juniper habitats (Zeiner et al. 1990).  They prefer sites with cover of types such as brush, logs, rubbish, and woodrat nests, but it has been captured in gravel deserts (Zeiner et al. 1990).  The elevation ranges from 0-2,618m (NatureServe 2004, California Department of Fish and Game 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCRGSx", "ELCode": "AMABA05010", "scientific_name": "Notiosorex crawfordi", "ITIS_TSN": "179973", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101665", "common_name": "Crawford's Gray Shrew"}}
