Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. 279 pp."}, "habitat_description": "The Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) is a small secretive marsh bird that is primarily found in freshwater marshes but can also be found in many other wetland types of any size, including saltwater marshes, roadside ditches, borders of lakes and streams, swampy grasslands, wet fields and meadows, irrigated hayfields, and cattail marshes (Taylor 1998, Andrews and Righter 1992, NatureServe 2001).  It feeds by probing mudflats and shallow water with its long, slightly decurved bill while searching for invertebrates, small fish, and, sometimes, seeds, but can also sometimes be found foraging in upland areas adjacent to wetlands (Conway 1995).  Virginia Rails build their nests in clumps of vegetation over or immediately adjacent to water in a variety of emergent vegetation types, but cattails and bulrush are frequently used (Conway 1995, Nicholson 1997).  \r\n\r\nThe most important factors for determining habitat suitability for Virginia Rails are the availability of shallow water, emergent vegetation for cover, and prey (e.g. the combination of invertebrate densities and the suitability of substrate for foraging), so the dominant plant species in a marsh is not considered a good indication of habitat suitability (Conway 1995).  The interspersion of open water and vegetation is also an important habitat component for this species, and it is most common in wetlands with 40-70% upright emergent vegetation interspersed with open water, mudflats and/or matted vegetation (Brewer et al. 1991, Conway 1995).  In some areas they show a preference for wetlands with homogenous vegetative cover but in others they prefer heterogeneous cover (Conway 1995).  \r\n\r\nAlthough Virginia Rails are considered to be wetland generalists, they show preferences for wetlands with 0-15 cm water depth over ones with deeper water, freshwater over saltwater, early successional wetlands over later succesional wetlands, low stem densities over high stem densities, small amounts of dead, residual vegetation, wetlands with high edge to area ratios, and wetlands with high pH and conductivity (Conway 1995).  \r\n\r\nVirginia Rails breed locally in the southwestern U.S., especially at lower elevations (Johnsgard 1992).  In Nevada, they breed in marshes, wet meadows, and slow moving streams (Alcorn 1988).  They are common in Utah in marshlands at lower elevations during the summer but are uncommon in these areas during the winter (UDWR 2003).  In Colorado, they are summer residents at lower elevations (up to 2,744 m) and in mountain parks, although they are rare in montane parks other than Rocky Mountains National Park (Johnsgard 1992, Andrews and Righter 1992).  They are uncommon summer residents in western valleys, mountain parks, and on eastern plains, rare winter residents in western valleys in Mesa, Delta, Gunnison, San Luis Valley, Rio Grande, and Alamosa counties and on the eastern plains, mostly near the foothills (Andrews and Righter 1992).  They breed in southwestern Arizona and central New Mexico (Conway 1995), and the eastern limits of their distribution in New Mexico are the upper Canadian and Middle and Lower Pecos valleys (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  They occur up to 2,287 m in riparian wooded lowland areas in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). \r\n\r\nThe winter habitat of the Virginia Rail is similar to its breeding habitat, except that they expand their distribution into areas farther away from open water and into brackish marshes as well (Conway 1995).  Its winter distribution in the West frequently follows major drainage systems, water-storage impoundments, irrigation districts, wet meadows, and irrigated hay fields.  N.
