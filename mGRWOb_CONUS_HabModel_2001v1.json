Mexican wolves were believed to have preyed upon white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer (O. hemionus), elk (Cervus elaphus), collared peccaries (javelina) (Tayassu tajacu), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), jackrabbits (Lepus spp.), cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.), and small rodents (Parsons and Nicholopoulos 1995, pp. 141-142); white-tailed deer and mule deer were believed to be the primary sources of prey (Brown 1988, p. 132; Bednarz 1988, p. 29). Today, Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico inhabit evergreen pine-oak woodlands (i.e., Madrean woodlands), pinyon-juniper woodlands (i.e., Great Basin conifer forests), and mixed-conifer montane forests (i.e., Rocky Mountain, or petran, forests) that are inhabited by elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer (Service [USFWS] 1996, pp. 3-5; AMOC and IFT 2005, p. TC-14, Reed et al. 2006, pp. 56, 61; Merkle et al. 2009, p.482)).\"\r\nThis species is not necessarily limited by specific habitat requirements but instead need areas where human populations occur at low densities so as to minimize persecution and where prey densities are high enough to support persistence (NatureServe 2015).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGRWOb", "ELCode": "AMAJA01032", "scientific_name": "Canis lupus baileyi", "ITIS_TSN": "726813", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104666", "common_name": "Mexican Wolf"}}
