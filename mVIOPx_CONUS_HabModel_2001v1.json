In the western U.S., it occurs along the pacific coast and inland from Mexico to Canada, but it is not native there and was introduced to L.A. in 1890, San Jose in 1910, and Visalia, CA at an unknown date (Krause and Krause 2006).  In Arizona, Virginia Opossums are probably not native (Hoffmeister 1986); although lacking release records from the southern part of Arizona might indicate that opossums have moved up to southern Arizona from Mexico (Hoffmeister 1986).  \r\n\r\nMany sources have reported a strong association with human development, water, and edge.  Beatty et al. (2014) tested hypothesis about the Opossum\u2019s reliance upon anthropogenic habitat near the northern limit of its range (Indiana).  Their habitat selection models indicated that while anthropogenic habitats are important, native habitats, especially edges, are heavily used as well.  Opossum populations consistently occurred in places with high forest-open edge density near forest patches and roads.  \r\n\r\nWater is also a likely influence on Opossum distributions as well, but information on the strength of this relationship is somewhat variable.  Some say they prefer moister, wooded situations (Kissel and Kennedy 1992; Layne et al. 1977; McManus 1974) but Zeiner et al. (1990) indicated that they need access to drinkable water, so they are to some degree limited to areas \u201cnear\u201d streams and other water sources (Zeiner et al. 1990, Krause and Krause 2006). However, Fitzgerald et al. (1994) called them \u201cadaptable\u201d, and indicated they can survive in wooded or brushy canyon country .  \r\n\r\nVirginia Opossums will occur in almost any land cover type from sea level to elevations over 3000 m (Feldhamer et al. 2003).  Indviduals have been documented in tropical hammock, coastal mangrove, mixed cypress/flatwoods, prairie, sawgrass with tree islands, longleaf pine/turkey oak, salt marsh, willow, beaches, coastal scrub, suburbia, agricultural, and disturbed areas (Layne 1984; Pearson 1954),  in bayheads, and river swamps (Moore 1946).  In Wyoming, records of occurrence exist for riparian cottonwood stands, cattail wetlands, agricultural areas, roadside\\railroad banks, and urban areas.  All but one of the sight records for D. virginiana in New Mexico came from grassland or desert areas (Findely et al. 1975).  One sighting was in pinon-juniper woodland, and opossums may be expected to inhabit cottonwood forests (Findley et al. 1975). In Colorado, opossums are most abundant in riparian areas bordering agricultural lands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  In Great Plains, they are mostly, but not exclusively, along large rivers such as Mississippi, Missouri, North Platte, and Niobrara and their tributaries (Krause & Krause 2006).  In California, they prefer moist woodlands, shrubby areas, wetlands, agricultural fields, and residential areas (Zeiner et al. 1990).  They are less common in conifer forests and grasslands.  N.
