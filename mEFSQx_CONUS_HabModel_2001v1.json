Their large size is advantageous in handling the large cones of longleaf pine and in traveling along the ground between widely spaced trees, food sources, and blocks of habitat (Weigl et al. 1989). They also use sandhills, turkey oak, improved pastures [savannah], golf courses, city parks, suburban areas, mangrove forest, cypress, mixed cypress/pine, and hammocks (Layne 1984 Layne et al. 1977). In the northern portions of its range (southern Appalachians and points north), oak-hickory groves are preferred. They are less abundant in forests with predominantly closed canopies where gray squirrels dominate (Webster et al. 1985). Adjacent bottomland hardwood forests may be occupied in summer and during periods of drought (see Handley 1991).  Habitat structure, specifically the size and spacing of pine and oak trees, appears to be more important than the actual species composition of the habitat (Taylor 1973, Hilliard 1979, Weigl et al. 1989).  Only stands with large mature trees appear to supply adequate supplies of food and nesting sites.  The use of edge habitats by fox squirrels is repeatedly mentioned in the literature (Smith and Follmer 1972, Flyger and Smith 1980, Nixon et al. 1984, Kantola 1986, Weigl et al. 1989, Cox 1990). Areas greater than 25 square km are needed for viable population maintenance (Kantola in Humphrey 1992). Tree hollows are preferred for rearing young, but leaf nests are also used.  In the southeastern U.S. most young are born in March-April.  Sometimes there is a smaller second peak in July-August (Weigl et al. 1989).  Gestation lasts 44-45 days (Moore 1957, Kantola 1986). Litter size generally averages 2-3. The earliest time of first breeding usually is the second calendar year and the maximum reproductive longevity of females is about 12-13 years.  The large size and low recruitment rates of fox squirrels in the southeastern U.S. suggest relatively long life spans (Moore 1953, Weigl et al. 1989).\r\nThe Delmarva Fox Squirrel prefers mixed pine and hardwood forests containing an abundance of acorns and pine cones and other food sources. Mature trees with cavities and an open understory or clumped shrubs (which provides space for slow, deliberate ground movements) are essential. Den sites are typically in tree hollows or constructed leaf nests (Dueser et al. 1988, Dueser 2000, Taylor 1976, USFWS 1993, Morris 2006, USFWS 2012).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains/Upper Midwest:\r\nThroughout the Midwest and south-central states, fox squirrels occur in mature open stands of oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) and other hardwoods, mixed hardwood-pine forests, and hardwood bottoms (Lowery 1974, Schmidly 1983, Caire et al. 1989, Sealander and Heidt 1990). Extensive agricultural development and resulting small woodlots and shelterbelt fencerows in many areas has created excellent fox squirrel habitat (Koprowski 1994)(quoted directly from Trani et al. 2007).\r\n\r\nNorthwest/Southwest:\r\nPopulations of Sciurus niger in the western states are introduced (Flyger and Gates 1982) and/or have been expanding westward along riverine corridors (Koprowski 1994). Small populations are scattered throughout the West including Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, and California. The fox squirrel ranges across most of the eastern and central U.S. and adjacent south-central Canada; New York to Florida, west along major river systems to Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana (NatureServe). Frey (2004) reports a natural population in Raton, Colfax County, New Mexico; and introduced populations in towns on the Llano Estacado (Lea Co) and in urban and riparian area in the Pecos River drainage of Chaves, Eddy and Lincoln counties, New Mexico. Found in a variety of deciduous and mixed-forest habitats, common in forest patches with an open understory (Koprowski 1994). The fox squirrel is often found in open mixed hardwood forest or mixed pine-hardwood associations, but has adapted well to disturbed areas, hedgerows, and city parks (NatureServe). Prefer savannas or open woodlands to dense forests (NatureServe). Highest numbers in habitats composed of trees that produce winter-storable food such as oaks, hickories, walnuts, and pines; but due to variability in mast production, a diversity of tree species is important (Koprowski 1994).  In the west, fox squirrels are associated with riverine corridors of cottonwoods (Koprowski 1994). In Colorado, the fox squirrel is found along river bottoms and in urban areas of the eastern plains (Fitzgerald et al.  1994). It is mostly an inhabitant of open deciduous forests (Fitzgerald et al.  1994). Foraging commonly occurs on the ground (NatureServe). Typical foods include nuts, fungi, seeds, berries, and shoots; other foods include tree buds and flowers and small amounts of insects and other animal material (NatureServe). Home ranges vary from 0.4 to 16.4 ha, depending on habitat and population density (Fitzgerald et al.  1994). Elevational range is from the eastern Colorado plains to 2,285 meters (Fitzgerald et al.  1994). CWSD has an elevational range of 914m to 2285m. In California, localized populations exist in urban areas and nearby rural settings including orchards/vineyards, and eucalyptus groves. Individuals are moving through valley foothill-hardwood riparian and redwood habitats (Gilroy 1980, [Harris et al. 2008 - CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990) as suggested by Koprowski (1994).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mEFSQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB07040", "scientific_name": "Sciurus niger", "ITIS_TSN": "180172", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105485", "common_name": "Eastern Fox Squirrel"}}
