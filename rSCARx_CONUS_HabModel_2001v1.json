Its range also extends from eastern Oklahoma to southern Texas, most of the Gulf Coast, into southern Florida excluding Lousiana (Conant and Collins 1991).\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits sandy, loamy well drained soils. It is found in conifer, hardwood, and mixed forests. Also, this semi-fossorial snake can be found in grassland and herbaceous woodlands (Behler and King 1979; Trauth et al. 2004). More specifically, the preferred habitats of the scarletsnake include dry prairie, salt grass prairie, irrigation canals of sawgrass prairie, pine flatwood, maritime hardwood hammock, sandhills, and borders of swamps. This snake is also reportedly found around plowed fields, roadsides, and abandoned fields (Tennant 1997; Werler and Dixon 2000).\r\n\r\nSE\t-  Pine flatwoods, dry prairie, salt grass prairie, bottomland forest, sandhills, hardwood hammock. Also found on the margins of irrigation canals, swamps, plowed fields, roadsides, and even abandoned crop fields (Tennant 1997; Werler and Dixon 2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSCARx", "ELCode": "ARADB03010", "scientific_name": "Cemophora coccinea", "ITIS_TSN": "174195", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105886", "common_name": "Scarletsnake"}}
