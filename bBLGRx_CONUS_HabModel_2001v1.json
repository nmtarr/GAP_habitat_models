This species is heavily parasitized by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) and a host for bronzed cowbird (M. aeneus) (Ingold 1993).  Other literature (Kingery 1998) maintains this species is rarely parasitized by cowbirds.  It feeds mainly on insects: grasshoppers and crickets (Ingold 1993).  \r\n\r\nBlue Grosbeaks are summer residents in New Mexico's Sandia Mountains (Tatschl 1967).  In Utah and Arizona, in the Virgin River Valley, preferred habitat is heavy ground cover, few trees, low shrubs, and low canopy (Ingold 1993).  It is a common summer resident in Arizona in willow, cottonwood, and moist mesquite-farmland and mesquite-grassland associations (Monson and Phillips 1981).  Habitat requirements appear to be heavy ground cover, few trees, low shrub density, and a low canopy in southwest Utah and northern Arizona and dense, low vegetation near water and open grassy areas in California (Lowther and Ingold 2011).  The Blue Grosbeak is a summer resident in southern Nevada and with limited numbers in western Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  They are usually found near water in Nevada and Utah in thickets and lowland valleys (Hayward et al. 1976, Behle et al. 1985, Alcorn 1988).  In Colorado, this species associates strongly with riparian habitat edges in lowlands and foothills; this species tends to place its nests in dense vegetation situated in otherwise open habitats (Kingery 1988).  \r\n\r\nThey are generally found below 1,830m in Colorado, but a few exceptions include a possible breeder at 2,500m (Kingery 1988).  It occurs below 2,134m in New Mexico (Ligon 1961).  N.
