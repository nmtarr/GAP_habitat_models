Reports of this species include Illinois, Indiana, southern Ohio, southwest Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and a small area in Texas. Other areas where this species occurs may include in the prairies of northeaster and southeastern South Dakota (Ballinger et al. 2000; Dodd 2013). Distribution of this species overlaps with the range of the gray treefrog (H. versicolor; tetraploid) in Maryland, southeaster West Virginia, south central Virginia, and in general from eastern Kansas to east Texas. Furthermore, overlap may occur in the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau (Little et al. 1989), southeastern Manitoba, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and in through south and northwestern Michigan. At least in Wisconsin, it has been described that Cope\u2019s gray treefrog are present in higher numbers than gray treefrogs in the southeastern prairie regions (Casper 1998). In general, habitat includes trees and shrubs found in or near water only descending at night for chorus and breeding (Behler and King 1979). Limited data is available comparing historical and current distribution (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nCope's gray treefrog, is often associated with hardwood or mixed pine-hardwood forests, woodlands and woodland edges. Breeding typically occurs in small ponds, borrow pits, roadside ditches, beaver ponds, or other standing water.  These treefrogs are also found in recently disturbed areas,with abundant shrubs, herbaceous growth, and vines (Wilson 1995).
