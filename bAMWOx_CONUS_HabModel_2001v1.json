In the remainder of the northeast region, the American woodcock is present in summer (breeding) only (see NE summer model)(Keppie and Whiting 1994; NatureServe 2009).\r\n\r\nBreeding habitat of the American woodcock is closely associated with young second-growth hardwoods and other early successional habitats (NatureServe 2009). Forest habitats with openings, such as young forest and abandoned farmland with mixed forest are ideal (Keppie and Whiting 1994). Forest openings and old fields provide display areas for males as grasses, herbaceous cover, and low shrubs are replaced by young trees (Keppie and Whiting 1994). \r\n\r\nThe American woodcock nests in young, open, second-growth deciduous forests with well-drained soils, and is more abundant in open forest than in denser deciduous sapling or conifer cover. Nesting habitat is geographically varied, and includes drier woodland sites, young open woodlands, low shrubby cover, old fields, tall herbage bordering clearings, thickets, scrub oaks or pines, open woodland with dead leaf cover on ground, and flat bottomlands near water. High shrub stem density and presence of edge habitat may be important in nest site selection in some areas (NatureServe 2009).\r\n\r\nWintering habitats are similar to the breeding habitats described above, but include more man-made habitas (e.g., rice fields, agricultural lands), and are not limited to early-successional forest types (Keppie and Whiting 1994; NatureServe 2009). In winter, the American woodcock will utilize a wider variety of forest types, including bottomland hardwoods, upland mixed pine-hardwoods, and mature longleaf pine that has been recently burned (Keppie and Whiting 1994). Occassionally, the species will also utilize coastal meadows (NatureServe 2009). C.
