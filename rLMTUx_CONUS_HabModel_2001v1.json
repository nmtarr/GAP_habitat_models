This species inhabits big and medium sized rivers, creeks, low gradient streams, shallow water pools, and springs. Also riparian areas such as, forested wetland and scrub-shrub wetland. Fallen logs, leaf litter, and soil are used for burrowing, but also the bases of stumps and the ground litter are used as nesting sites.\r\n\r\nThis species is known to climb onto tree branches near springs, rivers, oxbows, shallow lake margins, canals, and rivers. Described as a bottom dweller, the loggerhead musk turtle is often associated with rocks, logs, and plant cover when not basking (Ernst and Barbour 1972).\r\n\r\nDense vegetation found in riparian zones represents the primary source of cover. A significant time of the day is spent under water, under rocks, or under leaf/ground litter.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rLMTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAE02030", "scientific_name": "Sternotherus minor", "ITIS_TSN": "173761", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100024", "common_name": "Loggerhead Musk Turtle"}}
