This species of frog is currently listed as threatened in Illinois due to drainage conditions of hardwood swamps (Redmer and Kruse 1998 in Lannoo 2005). Preferred breeding habitat includes hardwood swamps and forested floodplains. Strong association with cypress (Taxodium distichum) and Tupelo gum (Nyssa aquatic) trees (Lannoo 2005). When not breeding, adults can be found in low vegetation or on the ground nearby swamps (Redmer et al.1999 in Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nThe range of this species comprises extreme southwestern South Carolina, southwest across Georgia, Florida panhandle, southern Alabama, Mississippi, western Kentucky, Tennessee, and extreme southern Illinois; Isolated populations occur west of the Mississippi in central and northwestern Louisiana, the Red River Drainage of extreme southeast Oklahoma and Arkansas (Lannoo 2005). Extreme south Illinois to Louisiana and east of the Florida panhandle. Isolated populations in central Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas (Conant and Collins 1991).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBVTRx", "ELCode": "AAABC02030", "scientific_name": "Hyla avivoca", "ITIS_TSN": "173511", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106363", "common_name": "Bird-voiced Treefrog"}}
