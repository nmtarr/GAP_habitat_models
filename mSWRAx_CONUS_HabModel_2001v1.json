They prefer mature forests, but these must be riparian. They are most abundant in thickets (especially cane), trees and vines bordering rivers and creeks. They commonly seek water to escape danger. Mean home range in Northern Georgia was 7.6 ha (Cothran 1991). Nests are built in slight depressions in the ground under brush piles or fallen branches, in hollow logs, or in holes along banks. The females regularly build dummy nests. Breeding season is from late January-midsummer (peak February-March) and gestation lasts 35-40 days. The litter size is 1-6 (2-3) and up to 5 litters may be produced per year.\r\nIn Texas, this species inhabits poorly  drained river bottoms and coastal marshes. In coastal areas, it is common within cane (Arundinaria) thickets, while inland it is restricted to river and stream floodplains among tangles of shrubs, trees, and vines (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSWRAx", "ELCode": "AMAEB01080", "scientific_name": "Sylvilagus aquaticus", "ITIS_TSN": "180121", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105645", "common_name": "Swamp Rabbit"}}
