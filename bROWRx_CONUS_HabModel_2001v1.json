Kroodsma and Greg H. Farley. 2000. Rock Wren (Salpinctes obsoletus), The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Retrieved from the Birds of North America Online: http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/486."}, "habitat_description": "The Rock Wren (Salpinctes obsoletus) is a western species that is commonly associated with rocky features but will also use nonrocky areas if there are sufficient \"crevices, interstices, passageways, recesses, and nooks and crannies of diverse shapes and sizes\" (Montana Field Guides 2012).  It forages along the ground, into cracks and crevices, along rocks, shrubs, and trees present in their otherwise barren habitat (Lowther et al. 2000).  Rock wrens generally nest in holes or crevices in boulders and rocky slopes (Merola 1995).\r\n\r\nSuitable rocky microhabitats include open rocky slopes, cliffs, eroded slopes, badlands, rocky outcrops, cliff walls, and talus slopes, talus slopes, boulders, scree, arroyos with sparse vegetation (Monson and Phillips 1981, Johnsgard 1986, NatureServe 2004).  \r\n\r\nMany sites used by the species are open and arid with little vegetation, but the species is also associated with xeric hillsides dominated by shrubs (Kingery 1998, BISON-M).  It is a common summer resident in northern Utah, found in rocky areas from desert lowlands to high mountain peaks (UDWR 2003).  Suitable matrix habitats for this species include ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and shrub steppes with sagebrush (Artemisia sp.), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus sp.), and antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentate; Lowther et al. 2000).  Lowther et al. (2000) listed habitat associations for several areas of the country, with scarcity of vegetation being a common theme among suitable systems: \u201crocky canyons, coulees, rocky outcroppings, clearcuts and talus slopes in steppe and dry forest zones,\u201d as well as alpine parkland habitats in Washington; \u201calong ocean cliffs and bluffs, breakwaters, and dry rocky coastal reefs, cliff faces, talus slopes and scree, alpine fell-fields, deep-cut arroyos, rocky outcroppings, dry gravely washes\u201d in California; \u201copen arid habitats dominated by rocks, including talus slopes, scree, and cliffs; bare, open, windswept, sunny areas with little vegetation; and piles of broken rocks, scattered boulders, or rocky outcrops\u201d in Colorado; and along the Smoky Hill River in Kansas \u201cin limestone breaks with abundant crevices\u201d as well as occasionally in scattered rocky outcrops and cliffs in central and western Kansas.  Rock Wrens are absent from riparian areas in the lower Colorado River valley where they are found in desert mesas and washes (Lowther et al. 2000).\r\n\r\nReported elevation information for the species are at -60 meters in California (BNA cited Smith 1994), and from 1,190 to 3,660 in Colorado (Lowther et al. 2000).\r\n\r\nDuring migration, they use grasslands and brushy slopes, riparian areas, and urban areas (Johnsgard 1986).  Winter habitat associations are similar to those of summer but at lower altitudes.  N.
