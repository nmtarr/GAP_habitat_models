They are abundant in shallow water with dense aquatic vegetation (Mecham 1967) and also in areas with unvegetated rocky or sandy bottoms (Sousa 1985).  Individuals can be found in communities ranging from northern boreal forests to coastal pine savannas and subtropical forests.  Eastern newts are notable for their terrestrial eft phase.  Efts typically move from aquatic habitat into mesic or wet situations in hardwood, mixed or evergreen forest.  Efts live on land for up to seven years (generally 4-6 years in western Maryland) before returning to water and beginning to breed.  Neotony is common and efts are rare (Ashton 1988).  They lay eggs singly attached to aquatic vegetation in late winter or early spring, sometimes in summer or fall.  The larvae hatch in 3-8 weeks (usually 2-3 in West Virginia).  They metamorphose to aquatic subadult or terrestrial efts in late summer or early fall.  They may burrow into mud if pond dries.  Adults are generally permanently aquatic in northeastern U.S., but may leave their ponds in summer or fall in some areas (e.g., montane Virginia).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aEANEx", "ELCode": "AAAAF01030", "scientific_name": "Notophthalmus viridescens", "ITIS_TSN": "173615", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106122", "common_name": "Eastern Newt"}}
