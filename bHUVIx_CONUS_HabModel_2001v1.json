It principally utilizes evergreen forests and woodlands with moderate to dense crown closure and understory. In Washington and Oregon, inhabits mixed, usually second-growth, forests of spruce (Picea spp.), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), hemlock (Tsuga spp.), Douglas-fir, and live oaks (Quercus spp.). In California, inhabits live oak woodlands and mixed forests containing non-deciduous oaks, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), madrone (Arbutus menziesii), tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), California bay-laurel (Umbellularia californica), incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), white fir (Abies concolor), and/or coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), mostly below 1,800 m elevation. In Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, inhabits pine, pine-oak, and pine-oak-juniper woodlands (Hutto 1985, Rappole and Blacklock 1994). Breeds to a lesser extent also in mixed evergreen/ deciduous forests throughout, mostly riparian-associated; in California, in arborescent chaparral, Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), bishop pine (Pinus muricata), foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana), and cypress (Cupressus spp.) plant associations (Grinnell and Miller 1944, Shuford 1993). Appears to reach peak abundance in habitat predominated by evergreen oaks; prefers this habitat more strongly than any of its congeners (Grinnell and Miller 1944, Root 1988). Breeding elevation ranges from near sea level along the Pacific coast to above 3,600 m in the highlands of Mexico (quoted directly from Davis 1995).\r\nIn the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona, Swarth (1904) estimates the elevational range between 5000 to 7500 feet (1500 \u2013 2270 meters). In New Mexico, observations of this species occurred between 5800 and 8100 feet (1760 \u2013 2450 meters; Bailey 1923).\r\nIn California, this species is most abundant in valley foothill hardwood, valley foothill hardwood-conifer, valley foothill riparian, montane hardwood, and closed-cone pine-cypress habitats. Closely associated with live oak woodlands, but also breeds in riparian habitats, locally in mixed chaparral, and in montane hardwood-conifer habitats up to 1800 m (6000 ft)(quoted directly from Green et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990). During winter Hutton's vireo will utilize essentially similar habitats to those used during the breeding season with the exception of extended use of riparian woodlands Phillips et al. 1964, Kaufman 1979, Gilligan et al. 1994).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bHUVIx", "ELCode": "ABPBW01190", "scientific_name": "Vireo huttoni", "ITIS_TSN": "178997", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101869", "common_name": "Hutton's Vireo"}}
