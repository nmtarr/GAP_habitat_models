In general, its habitat covers tropical and subtropical waters, in protected, shallow, marine and estuarine waters, including bays and lagoons (NMFS and USFWS 2007). \r\n\r\nIt burrows in or using sand from dunes. Nesting is highly synchronized in some areas having 100s to 10,000s of females may emerge and nest within a period of a few hours or days while solitary nesting also occurs. In the eastern Pacific, synchronized nesting occurs annually at several beaches in Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama from June through December; during the same period, ridleys emerge to nest solitarily along the entire coast from Mexico to Colombia (NMFS and USFWS 2007). Nesting occurs on upper beaches while individuals sometimes change to a different nesting beach within a single nesting season (Eckert et al. 1989).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rORSTx", "ELCode": "ARAAA04020", "scientific_name": "Lepidochelys olivacea", "ITIS_TSN": "173840", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106179", "common_name": "Olive Ridley Sea Turtle"}}
