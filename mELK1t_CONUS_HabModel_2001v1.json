Found in mountain meadows and forests during the summer and in foothills and valley grasslands during winter. They avoid deep snow.  Associated with semiopen forests or forest edges adjacent to parks, meadows, alpine tundra. In Colorado, the species ranges throughout the western two-thirds of state generally at elevations above 1800 m. Habitat: semiopen forest, mountain meadows, foothills, plains, valleys. Uses open areas such as alpine pastures, marshy meadows, river flats, aspen parkland, coniferous forest, brushy clear cuts, forest edges, and semi-desert areas. Elk in non-roaded habitats increased use of open timber types; in roaded habitat, they increased use of closed canopy timbered types. Begin moving down to exposed southern slopes at lower elevations when deepening snow piles up to about 20 inches (500 mm). At the present time, elk do well in Arizona in the mountainous areas that have extensive stands of forest. Small, isolated mountain ranges, with limited coniferous forest, do not provide good areas for elk.\r\nIn California, Tule Elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes) introduced to the Owens Valley use brush, scrub and herbaceous habitats year-round (McCullough 1969, [Alhorn et al. in CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In other parts of the state, C. e. roosevelti and C. e. nelsoni utilize open, brushy stands of deciduous and coniferous habitats (both forest and woodlands) as well as riparian areas, meadows, and herbaceous early successional forest environments ([Alhorn et al. in CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\nIn Oregon, elk are most abundant in the Blue and Wallowa mountains and northern coast range while being less abundant in the arid southeastern regions. Habitat is a mosaic of early succesional stages with abundant herbaceous forage, and later successional forested habitats that provide cover. In the western part of the state, early successional foraging habitats are most often provided by clearcut and burned forest stands (Verts and Carraway 1998). In the Blue Mountains, Leckenby (1984) found that >80% of foraging habitat for elk consisted of a forest/open ecotone 600 yards (550 m) wide. Ecotones of forest/woodland and early successional and shrub habitats are very important landscape features of high quality elk habitat (Skovlin et al. 2002). In general, habitat management guidelines for elk recommend maintaining landscapes that provide 40% cover and 60% forage consisting of tall shrub, woodland, and forested habitat; and open spaces of low shrub and herbaceous vegetation respectively (Skovlin et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mELK1t", "ELCode": "AMALC01011", "scientific_name": "Cervus elaphus nannodes", "ITIS_TSN": "898525", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103199", "common_name": "Tule Elk"}}
