Habitats include the following: secondary hardwood forests; white pine and hemlock; white oak; hemlock and black birch; beech; spruce and hardwood forests; open fields; old pasture land with a thin cover of young trees and shrubs; cultivated fields; roadsides (Eadie 1939, Handley and Patton 1947, McKeever 1951). This mole is most abundant in sandy loam soils with good surface cover and sufficient moisture (Eadie 1939). The degree of rockiness is unimportant, but soils with high moisture or clay contents are avoided (Eadie 1939, Olive 1950).\" (quoted directly from Hallett 1978). Elevational records include: New York, 182 to 915 m (Conner 1960); Virginia, 915 to 1675 m (Handley and Patton 1947); West Virginia, 182 to 808 m (McKeever 1951); North Carolina 915 m (Jackson 1915).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nThe hairy-tailed mole lives in the mountains in a variety of soil types with various plant dominants, including conifers, hardwoods, rhododendrons, meadows, fields, and pastures (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998; Brown 1997). They prefer well-drained, light, moist soil with well-mixed organic matter and minerals. In Georgia and North Carolina hairy-tailed moles occur only at high elevations of the Blue Ridge at elevations generally above 2000ft (Lee et al. 1982). Males leave tunnel systems in search of females during the March-April breeding season. Gestation lasts 4 weeks. The litter size is 4-5, usually with 1 litter annually. Sexual maturity is attained 11 months after birth.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mHTMOx", "ELCode": "AMABB03010", "scientific_name": "Parascalops breweri", "ITIS_TSN": "179977", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103941", "common_name": "Hairy-tailed Mole"}}
