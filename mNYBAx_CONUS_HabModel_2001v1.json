The average distance from center of the roost area to a foraging location was 109 m on Sapelo Island, GA (Menzel et al. 2003), but this was based on one individual.  NatureServe (2005) classes this bat in the small to medium bat category where they list several other species in the Vespertilionidae family (e.g. Myotis sodalis, lucifugus, & septentrionalis, and Corynorhinus townsendii) as moving between 1.04Km to 4.2 Km, with C. townsendii up 10.5Km) from roosting to foraging ground (this is in the population/occurrence delineation section).

They are strongly associated with Spanish Moss in which they roost and rear their young (Barbour & Davis 1969, Whitaker & Hamilton 1998, Choate et al. 1994 & Webster et al. 1980).  Florida and Georgia roosts are usually in live oaks near permanent water bodies, but they roost in palm trees in southern Texas (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Northern yellow bats are most commonly associated with longleaf pine/turkey oak sandhill and live oak hammock (Jennings 1958 cited in Kern 1992), as well as open flatwoods (Layne et al. 1977). They forage 15-20 feet above the ground over open areas and scattered shrubs or trees, or along forest edge, pastures, airports, golf courses, lake edge, and savannahs (Kern in Humphrey 1992, Ammerman et al. 2012).
