In New Mexico, T. sirtalis is seldom found distant from moist river valley habitats. In Colorado, common garter snake inhabits marshes, ponds, and the edges of streams. For the most part, it is restricted to aquatic, wetland, and riparian habitats along the floodplains of streams. Found in many environments - in grassland, woodland, scurb, chapparal, and forest. Lives in or near ponds, marshes, prairie swales, roadside ditches, streams, sloughs, damp meadows, woods, farms and city lots.  In northern New Mexico, this species is primarily located along the Rio Grande and tributaries.\r\n\r\nNWGAP\r\nThis species is found in Washington, Oregon and Idaho in the North West region of its range. As is typical for the gartersnakes it is associated with water. It occurs in many habitat types that are associated with a water source. Elevation range is sea level to 2400 m.\r\n\r\nFrom NatureServe\r\nEstuarine Habitat(s): Herbaceous wetland\r\nRiverine Habitat(s): BIG RIVER, CREEK, Low gradient, MEDIUM RIVER, Moderate gradient, Pool, SPRING/SPRING BROOK\r\nLacustrine Habitat(s): Shallow water\r\nPalustrine Habitat(s): Bog/fen, FORESTED WETLAND, HERBACEOUS WETLAND, Riparian, SCRUB-SHRUB WETLAND, TEMPORARY POOL\r\nTerrestrial Habitat(s): Bare rock/talus/scree, Cropland/hedgerow, Forest - Conifer, Forest - Hardwood, Forest - Mixed, Grassland/herbaceous, Old field, Suburban/orchard, Woodland - Conifer, Woodland - Hardwood, Woodland - Mixed\r\nHabitat Comments: Throughout the range, common gartersnakes inhabit a very wide range of aquatic, wetland, and upland habitats; habitat preference exhibits rather pronounced regional differences (e.g., east vs. west). In some regions, such as much of eastern North America, these snakes are decidedly terrestrial and range far from water. In other areas, such as the Rocky Mountain region, they are mostly confined to riparian corridors.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rCOGAx", "ELCode": "ARADB36130", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis sirtalis", "ITIS_TSN": "174136", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101158", "common_name": "Common Gartersnake"}}
