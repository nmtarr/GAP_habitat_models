In southeastern Arizona, peccaries tend to avoid recently burned sacaton grasslands because these areas lack adequate cover (Bock and Bock 1979). In southern Arizona, only a \u201csmall area of natural vegetation\u201d is required for peccary persistence if adjacent to agricultural fields (Sowls 1997).\r\nThis species occurs on bajada slopes and mouths of canyons of many mountain ranges (Hoffmeister 1986). In the Tortolita Mountains, Bigler (1964) described his study are as characterized by flats and bajadas at lower elevations to about 2600 feet elevation, where the terrain becomes rugged foothills. More urban-dwelling javalina locations were on hillsides during the day (88.9%) than at night (48.1%; Ticer et al. 1998).\r\nSeldom abundant in absence of dense, scrubby ground cover. Often in thickets along creeks and washes. In southern Texas, prime habitat was dense scrub cover with succulents (Ilse and Hellgren 1995). Schmidly (2004) describes habitat as brushy, semi-desert with dense thickets of prickly pear, chaparral, scrub oak, or guajillo, as well as rocky canyons and hollows amidst barren areas.\r\nIn New Mexico, peccaries occur mainly in the southwestern portion of the state but there are isolated populations in the Cedar, Tres Hermanas, Florida, and San Andres Mountains (Feldhammer et al. 2003). On the Zuni Indian Reservation, New Mexico, animals were observed at elevations up to 2,335 m in pi\u00f1on-juniper and ponderosa pine habitats (Albert et al. 2004).
