They may be common in shaded hardwood forests, wooded floodplains, and on the slopes of shaded ravines, and may also occasionally inhabit pinewoods in locations near hardwood bottomlands.  Optimal habitat is moist and has a ground layer of humus and leaf litter.  They can also be found in dry to swampy hammock lands (Carr and Goin 1955).  They are absent from high elevation coniferous spruce-fir forests in the mountains (King 1939, Martof et al. 1980).  They retreat underground during dry or freezing weather.  Breeding tends to be biennial in the north and at higher elevations and annual in the south and at low elevations. They lay up to about 3-dozen eggs (late spring in north, August-September in south) in rotting logs, underground, or in rock crevices. The larval stage passed in egg with female in attendance. Hatching occurs in late summer in the north and in the fall in the south.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aACSSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12500", "scientific_name": "Plethodon chlorobryonis", "ITIS_TSN": "208282", "Global_SEQ_ID": "732489", "common_name": "Atlantic Coast Slimy Salamander"}}
