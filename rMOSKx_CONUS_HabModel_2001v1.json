In this region, the mole skink occupies areas dominated by conifer woodland, hardwood woodland, and mixed woodland.\r\n\r\nThe preferred conditions within its range include coastal dunes, longleaf pine-turkey oak woods, xeric hammocks, and sand pine scrub. The mole skink is primarily considered fossorial, burrowing in or using soil, fallen logs, and ground litter. Also found under rocks and tidal wrack on beaches. This species uses pocket gopher burrows and mounds, as well as burrowing beetle mounds. Populations are reported to thrive where soil conditions are sandy or gravelly and dry. Furthermore, the eggs are laid in a cavity dug in sandy soil, at a depth ranging from several inches up to 6 feet below the surface (Mount 1975).\r\n\r\nSand pine scrub, longleaf pine-turkey oak woods, and xeric hammocks. Uses pocket gopher burrows and mounds and burrowing beetle mounds.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rMOSKx", "ELCode": "ARACH01040", "scientific_name": "Plestiodon egregius", "ITIS_TSN": "208885", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103910", "common_name": "Mole Skink"}}
