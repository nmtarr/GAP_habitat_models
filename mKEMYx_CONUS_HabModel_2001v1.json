It is associated with mature, coastal forest, and roosts in large living and dead trees.  Most individuals probably roost in tree cavities year round (Bat Conservation International 2013), but records of roosts in building and rock crevices exist (Bolan et al. 2009).  Males and females have slightly different habitat associations (Boland et al. 2009).  Females roosted in coniferous trees, especially Cedars, and showed a preference for trees closer to streams.  Males roosted in trees but we less discriminating in roost selection than females.  They are known to forage over ponds and upland forested areas (Fitch and Shump 1979).\r\n\r\nThe only known maternity colonies in British Columbia were below 240 m, but known hibernacula are above 400 m (Fitch and Shump 1979).
