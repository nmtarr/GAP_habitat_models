In Clark County, Nevada, this species was trapped at seepage areas or close to tamarisk or mesquite trees in the southern portion of the state at Granite Springs (Ryser 1964). This species usually occurs within rocky and sloping topography (Lackey 1991).  In the United States, it occurs from southern Nevada southward in a narrow strip to the U.S.-Mexico boundary (Lackey 1991).\r\nIn California, \"two forms occur, C. s. rufescens occurs in rough terrain and narrow washes\r\nin hillls south from Palm Springs to the border of Mexico (Riverside and San Diego cos.). C. s.\r\nspinatus inhabits the southeastern corner of the state on rocky slopes vegetated by desert\r\nscrub (Grinnell 1933), from Needles south along the Colorado River Valley to the border of\r\nMexico. Few reports of this species can be found. It seems to prefer sparsely covered\r\ndesert scrub habitats on stony soils and rocky washes. The elevational range is from 45-900\r\nm (150-3000 ft).\" (quoted directly from [Brylski et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). This species is known to dig burrows at the base of desert shrubs along rocky mesas, hillsides, and desert washes.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSPMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFD05090", "scientific_name": "Chaetodipus spinatus", "ITIS_TSN": "552487", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100459", "common_name": "Spiny Pocket Mouse"}}
