This species is often found in riparian areas, especially in more arid environs (Kus et al. 2010). The Bell's vireo is largely absent from cultivated areas, forests, pure grasslands and open deserts (Brown 1993). In South Dakota, the Bell's vireo is typically found in green ash woodlands. In the northern Great Plains, this species utilizes cottonwood woodlands (Kus et al. 2010).\r\n\r\nIn California, the species is rare (least Bell's vireo, the subspecies found in the state, is a state endangered species), but was historically found within areas with dense shrub layers, especially willows, in riparian and upland habitats (Kus et al. 2010). \r\n\r\nIn Arizona, the species utilizes mesquite, especially in riparian areas, as well as dense, shrubby vegetation, frequently near intermittent or perennial sources of water (Kus et al. 2010). In southeastern Arizona, this species occurs in dense shrubs and trees of lower canyons, generally below the oak zone, and along desert streams and washes (Edison et al. 1995).\r\n\r\n In New Mexico, it is \u201crare to fairly common in lowland riparian shrubland, woodland and adjacent microphyll shrubland\" (Hubbard 1978).\r\n\r\nBrown (1987, 1989) observed this species nesting within vegetation characterized by honey mesquite, catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), redbud (Cercis canadensis) and scrub oak (Quercus turbinella) between Glen Canyon Dam and Diamond Creek, Grand Canyon.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBEVIx", "ELCode": "ABPBW01110", "scientific_name": "Vireo bellii", "ITIS_TSN": "179003", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100979", "common_name": "Bell's Vireo"}}
