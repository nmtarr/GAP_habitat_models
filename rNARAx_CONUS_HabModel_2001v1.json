It is not common in New Mexico with occurrences reported only in grasslands, brushlands and woodlands of the northeastern part of the state and the Rio Grande Valley. The racer uses rocks, deadfall, and wood from old houses or corrals as cover (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Stebbins (2003) described the racer to prefer open habitats, meadows, prairies, sagebrush flats, open chaparral, pinon/juniper woodlands, and forest glades. Absent from extremely dry areas and high mountains. Its range expands from southern British Columbia, southern Saskatchewan, Wisconsin, Michigan, southern Ontario, New York, and southern Maine southward in the United States to southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, the Gulf Coast, and southern Florida, and southward through northeastern, central, into southern Mexico to Guatemala and Belize.\r\n\r\nNW\t-forest glades, riparian zones.\r\nUM\t\r\nNE\t\r\nSW-\topen habitats, meadows, prairies, sagebrush flats, open chaparral, pinon/juniper woodlands, and streamsides.\r\nGP\t-Semi agricultural areas, plateaus, prairies, meadows.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rNARAx", "ELCode": "ARADB07010", "scientific_name": "Coluber constrictor", "ITIS_TSN": "174169", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103328", "common_name": "North American Racer"}}
