Individuals are nearly always found near human habitation, but they can sometimes be found in undeveloped areas far from human settlements (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Rosenberg et al. 1991, Johnston 1992, Alderfer 2006).   \r\n\r\nIn undeveloped areas, Rock Pigeons nest gregariously along rocky seacoasts or inland on cliff ledges or in holes and fissures within gorges, river valleys, caves, and desert oases (AOU 1983, Rosenberg et al. 1991).  More often, individuals occupy human settlements; building nests on the ledges of buildings, bridges, monuments, barns, and abandoned houses (AOU 1983, Rosenberg et al. 1991, Johnston 1992, Nicholson 1997).  They typically nest within one kilometer of foraging areas in open country with short vegetation such as parks, yards, pastures, open scrub vegetation, plowed fields, feedlots, and farmyards.  In the Colorado River Valley, they are a locally common resident and breeder in the lower Colorado River Valley wherever residential areas occur while most individuals remain near cities, trailer parks, farm houses, and feedlots (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  Found statewide throughout Nevada, but is most common in and near larger cities and towns, near cattle feedlots, and near available nesting sites such as cliffs or large buildings (Alcorn 1988).  \r\n\r\nRock Pigeons forage in early morning or mid-afternoon on seeds, fruits, and, rarely, invertebrates (Johnston 1992).  In cities, they rely heavily on human food sources and thus consume a great deal of bread and other scraps (Goodwin 1983, Nicholson 1997).  North American Rock Pigeons have been documented traveling up to 26 km from roosts to feeding areas (Johnston 1992).\r\n\r\nReported elevation limits are 3,049 m in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992) and 2,200 m in Nevada and New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, Ammon 2005).\r\n\r\nSummer and winter habitats are the same.\r\n\r\nN.
