Rough-skinned newts also occur near the east slope of the Cascades in Washington and along the west slope of the Sierra Nevada of northern California. Reports of isolated populations include localities in Moscow, Idaho, and Thompson Falls in Montana as a result of possible introductions (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Monello and Wright 1997). This species occurs at elevations from sea level to approximately 2800 meters (Green et al. 2013). This species is considered common in the Pacific northwest (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Gilbert and Allwine 1991). Terrestrial adults have been reported with more frequency in riparian than in upslope habitats, usually in association with deciduous forests (Gomez and Anthony 1996). In the Oregon Coast Range and southern Washington Cascade Range, higher abundance was associated with old-growth stands than in young and mature ones, but not statistically significant (Corn and Bury 1991; Lannoo 2005). Close proximity to water is a better predictor of abundance that possibly confounds effects of forest age (Bury et al. 1991). \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that mating has been reported in quiet and slow-flowing waters, such as ponds, reservoirs, lakes, drainage ditches, and the slow flowing portions of streams (Stebbins 1985). It is presumed that egg deposition sites are similar to mating sites, with a strong preference of this species for spawning in quiet aquatic habitats than the other species of newts (Twitty 1942; Lannoo 2005). For larvae, cover provided by stones and under vegetation is critical (Licht and Brown 1967). \r\n\r\nTerrestrial habitats for adults and some juveniles includes coniferous forests, oak-woodland, redwood forests, grasslands, and farmland, but most of the day is spent in burrows or beneath cover (Stebbins 1951; Nussbaum et al. 1983). \r\n\r\nAdult density lies about 300 individuals/ha, with a maximum density of 2700/ha (Efford and Mathias 1969).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRSNEx", "ELCode": "AAAAF02010", "scientific_name": "Taricha granulosa", "ITIS_TSN": "173620", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100302", "common_name": "Rough-skinned Newt"}}
