It forages along the ground on grasses, sedges, and herbs adjacent to burrows (Gill 1977). Throughout its range, M. californicus occupies fresh and brackish marshes, valley annual grasslands, upland meadows as well as agricultural areas utilizing underground burrows and surface runways through vegetation (NatureServe). In Oregon, this species is associated with early seral communities with common velvet grass, blue wildrye, salal, and Oregongrape including these vegetative associations post clearcut (Borrecco and Hooven 1972, Verts and Carraway 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCAVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11030", "scientific_name": "Microtus californicus", "ITIS_TSN": "180305", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102779", "common_name": "California Vole"}}
