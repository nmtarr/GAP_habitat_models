A field guide to the nests, eggs and nestlings of North American birds. Collins, Cleveland, Ohio."}, "habitat_description": "The Eastern Screech-Owl occurs east of the Rocky Mountains, where it is a permanent resident of both rural and urban habitats from south of the Canadian boreal forest to near the Tropic of Cancer in Mexico. This species nests in tree cavities in wooded environments below about 1,500 meters, regardless of habitat, occupying lowland forests to mountainside woodlands, both deciduous and evergreen. Because it readily habituates to people, this species sometimes nests in human-made cavities such as bird boxes. It is often the most common or only avian predator in wooded suburban and urban habitats.Generally, habitat consists of tree-dominated landscapes of most types, spanning age classes early successional to mature and elevations from mountain slopes to river valleys below 1500 meters. Forested environments include northern and subtropical deciduous and mixed forest, riparian deciduous and southern pine (Pinus) forest, southwestern oak (Quercus)-juniper (Juniperus) and subtropical thorn woodland, urban and suburban yards, parks, and green belts. Marginal in boreal and montane coniferous forest (quoted directly from Gehlbach 1995).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nThis owl forages in open fields, clearings and edges (Hamel 1992).  In south-central Iowa, the highest use of nest boxes occurred in riparian sites (Iowa Bird Life, 1990).  They use open woodland, deciduous forest, orchards, woodland/forest edge, swamps, parklands, residential areas in towns, scrub, and riparian woodland in drier regions. Evergreen woodland/forest is little used in northeastern U.S (NATURESERVE). However it is reported that they may favor pine woods and mixed woods over bottomlands and swamps (Hamel 1992). Habitats with the greatest use included red maple woodland (41.2%), lawn (16.0%), and edge (9.0%) (Smith & Gilbert  1984). In urban or suburban yards, parks, and greenbelts the only requirement appears to the presence of a cavity tree or nest box (Gehlbach 1995).\r\nEastern screech owls nest in open to medium growth pine, deciduous, or mixed forests; also in agricultural, suburban, scrub and riparian woods (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Nicholson 1997). Will nest in parks and suburban areas that provide large shade trees with cavities for nesting (Johnsgard 1988). Generally nests in tree cavities, such as abandoned Pileated Woodpecker and Flicker holes (Harrison 1975), but also hollow stumps (Ehrlich et al.1988), crevices in buildings, birdhouses, and nest boxes (Ehrlich et al.1988), particularly those made specifically for owls or Wood Ducks (Nicholson 1997). Nests have been found in cavities ranging from 1.5 m to 16.8 m above ground (Harrison 1975, Duley 1979); an average cavity depth of 31 cm has been suggested as an important factor (Belthoff and Ritchison 1990).\r\nRegarding spatial habitat characteristics, total observed home range for males was 103.4 ha with a maximum diameter of 1.27 km; and for females it was 130.2 ha with a maximum diameter of 1.55 km. Home range is largest while a female is selecting a nest, and smallest during egg laying, incubation, and care of young (Smith & Gilbert  1984). # Home range size of 136 acres (Schoener 1968).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn urban-suburban and rural central Texas, this species uses deciduous forest, oak-hickory (Carya) and oak-juniper woodland, as well as creek, woodlot, yard, patio, road edges (Gehlbach 1994). In area of overlap with Western Screech-owl (TX), occurs mostly along permanent watercourses at lower elevations; while the Western inhabits seasonally wet, upland drainages (quoted directly from Gehlbach 1995).\r\n\r\nNortheast:\r\nIn suburban Connecticut (Smith and Gilbert 1984) and rural Kentucky (Sparks et al. 1994), O. a. asio uses deciduous woods and edges (e.g., fencerows, streams, and hedgerows) more than evergreen woods, lawns, fields, pastures, or cropland (quoted directly from Gehlbach 1995).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe Eastern Screech-Owl breeds east of the Rocky Mountains from southern Canada to central Mexico to the Atlantic (Gehlbach 1995, Kingery 1998). In the southwest region, the subspecies maxwelliae of the Eastern Screech-Owl occurs in eastern Colorado where it is a permanent resident in both urban and rural habitats (Gehlbach 1995, Kingery 1998). Otus asio maxwelliae occurs year round on the northeastern plains, the Arkansas River drainage, and the foothills and lower mountains of the Colorado Front Range (Andrews and Righter 1992). \r\nThe Eastern Screech-Owl inhabit woodlots, open woods, urban parks, and residential areas that are often near water, fields, and forest clearings (Gehlbach 1995, Kingery 1998). Rural habitats are usually found in low elevation riparian woodlands below 1500m (Gehlbach 1995). Urban habitats usually occur in older residential areas with mixes of mature cottonwoods (Populus spp.) and maples (Acer spp.) (Kingery 1998). Prefers open subcanopy with sparse shrub cover for flying, foraging, and predator detection (Gehlbach 1995).  The Eastern Screech Owl will build its nest in the cavities of deciduous trees, but will also use nesting boxes (Kingery 1998). Highest densities of nesting Eastern Screech Owls in Colorado appear to be associated with groves of large cottonwood trees (Kingery 1998). The Eastern Screech-Owl prefers to hunt along forest edges, open meadows, and streams (Kingery 1998). Prey species taken by the screech owl include birds, rodent, and invertebrates (Gehlbach 1995). \r\nThe data for the range in elevation is taken from the Colorado Wildlife Species Database.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bEASOx", "ELCode": "ABNSB01030", "scientific_name": "Megascops asio", "ITIS_TSN": "686658", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102821", "common_name": "Eastern Screech-owl"}}
