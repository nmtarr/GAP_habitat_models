More recent reports include populations in the Washington range eastward into Klickitat County (Herrington 1985), and northward into Lewis County Washington (Aubry et al. 1987). \r\nPopulations are described in association with talus in isolated patches of habitat usually separated by large areas of unsuitable habitat. Recently, clearcutting and soil deposition on talus has severely damaged their habitat. In addition, along the Washougal River, residential development has increased, while also major road projects have been reported for Oregon putting populations of the Larch Mountain salamander at risk (Lannoo 2005). Adults are associated with steep, partially forested, talus slopes. Within these slopes, Herrington and Larsen (1985) have reported that moisture levels, rock size, and nutrient import are all important contributors to optimal habitat. In a separate occasion, individuals of this species have been reported at the entrance of an ice cave (Aubry et al. 1987). This species does not tolerate open canopy, as it results from clearcutting (Petranka 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aLMSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12100", "scientific_name": "Plethodon larselli", "ITIS_TSN": "173662", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101047", "common_name": "Larch Mountain Salamander"}}
