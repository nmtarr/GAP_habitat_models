Question is where is the range?\r\n\r\nThis species is found in northwestern Nevada at elevations below 1370m. Commonly found around Pyramid Lake, Winemucca Lake basin and the Lovelock area. Additionaly, this species is found in the Black Rock Desert. Its favorite habitat appears to be rocky slopes and outcrops (St. John 2002). In Arizona, it occurs in the Lower Colorado River Desertscrub into Great Basin Conifer Woodland (Brennan and Holycross 2009). The range includes a significant portion of Nevada, it also extends into southwestern Colorado, south to northern Baja California, Sinaloa, and Coahuila; west to west of the Central Valley in California, east to western Texas (Degenhardt et al. 1996; Dixon 2000). This species occupies southern regions of Great Basin Desert, southward through the Mojave and Sonoran deserts of Arizona and California. In New Mexico, this species has been reported from the Four Corners region to the Cienega San Simon and Granite Gap in the Peloncillo Mountains, Hidalgo County, and in the Pecos River valley. In Mexico, this lizard can be found as far as the southern tip of Baja California, Sinaloa, Coahuila, northeastern Durango, and in islands in the Sea of Cortez (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Jones and Lovich (2009) reported the range of this species includes the Colorado Plateau in southeastern Utah, contiguous areas of Arizona and Colorado, and extreme northwestern New Mexico.\r\n\r\nMesquite-yucca grassland, mesquite and juniper woodland, edges of arroyos and playas, cottonwood and willow zones. Arid to semi arid habitat, shrubland, conifer and grassland-woodland. Riparian habitat in Arizona and New Mexico.  Also, creosote bush, velvet mesquite, burro bush, greasewood, cacti, sagebrushes, saltbushes, junipers, and grasses. In riparian areas, arrow weed, tamarisk, Fremont cottonwood, palms, and willows (Jones and Lovich 2009).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rYBSLx", "ELCode": "ARACF1406b", "scientific_name": "Sceloporus uniformis", "ITIS_TSN": "1056662", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106473", "common_name": "Yellow-backed Spiny Lizard"}}
