As eastern forests have regenerated or been urbanized, the species\u2019 range has contracted westward (Martin and Parrish 2000).\r\n\r\nLark Sparrows live in open grassland or herbaceous habitats that are adjacent to or contain scattered trees or shrubs (Johnsgard 1979, Verner and Boss 1980, American Onithologists' Union 1983).  The presence of woody shrubs or trees is an important component of Lark Sparrow habitat (Martin and Parrish 2000).  These habitats include shrub-steppe adjacent to woodlands or grasslands (1-2 m vertical structure such as sagebrush [Artemisia spp.], greasewood [Sarcobatus vermiculatus], and mesquite [Prosopis spp.]), pi\u00f1on-juniper edges, grasslands, roadsides, farmlands/cultivated habitats, orchards, park-like woodlands, savannas, mesquite grasslands, fallow fields with brushy edges, desert scrub such as shadscale saltbush (Atriplex confertifolia ), rocky canyons with springs, Utah Juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), brush juniper\u2013big sagebrush (A. tridentate) and pastures  (DeGraaf et al. 1991, Martin and Parrish 2000).  They can be found in association with prairie dog towns (Lomolino and Smith 2004).  \r\nIn woodlands, hardwood species are preferred over coniferous species and sparse canopy cover (<24%) is preferred.  In grasslands, moderate to dense cover is preferred (40-100%) and occupied grasslands include those with poor soils, heavily grazed areas, early seral stages following crop field abandonment, and native prairie grasslands (Martin and Parrish 2000).  In fact, some research has showed the species prefers grazed habitats over non-grazed ones (Martin and Parrish 2000).  \r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, Lark Sparrows frequent various disturbance features such as rock outcrops, sandhills, and erosion gullies that provide sparse groundcover interspersed with bare substrate.  In Tennessee, important habitats include limestone cedar glades and pastures in the Central Basin.  In Texas, this species is a common ground-nesting songbird associated with mesquite grassland (Prosopis glandulosa) with tobosa (Pleuraphis mutica) (Renwald 1977).  \r\n\r\nThe Lark Sparrow is an abundant summer resident in the semidesert grasslands of southeastern Arizona where it can be found in areas of common mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), lovegrasses (Eragrostis intermedia, E. lehmanniana), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), and threeawns (Aristida spp.), shrubs of baccharis (Baccharis pteronoides) and goldenweed (Haplopappus tenuisectus), and oak woodlands consisting of Quercus emoryi, Quercus arizonica, Juniperus deppeana, Juniperus monosperma, Pinus leiophylla, and Pinus cembroides (Balda 1970, Bock and Bock 1998).  Martin and Parrish (2000) reported the results of a study from northeast Colorado \u201ccomparing relative abundance of avian populations along the South Platte River riparian and shortgrass prairie (blue grama [Boutelua gracilis], western wheatgrass [Agropyron smithii], and sand dropseed [Sporobolus cryptandrus]) communities.\u201d  Early in their breeding season (March-May), Lark Sparrows occupied areas outside of the floodplain in overgrazed weedy annual grasses and forbs with widely spaced plains cottonwoods (Populus deltoides).  During the peak of the breeding season (June\u2013August), they were observed at the fringes of floodplains in sedge (Carex spp.), rush (Juncus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), and cottonwood, in addition to overgrazed prairie habitat.  They were found in open cottonwood, floodplains with dense vegetation (primarily small cottonwoods and weedy annuals that were intermittently scoured during flood events), and over-grazed prairie habitats during fall (September \u2013 November).  In Bonneville Basin, UT, the application of fire increased the Lark Sparrow densities in juniper-brush containing Utah juniper, sagebrush, four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), greasewood, horsebrush (Tetradymia spp.), rabbitbrush, and hopsage (Grayia spinosa), and mixed-brush containing Wyoming sagebrush (A. tridentata var. wyomingesis), four-wing saltbush, horsebrush, budsage (Artemisia spinescens), shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), and galleta grass (Hilaria jamesii) that had been heavily infested with cheatgrass, Russian thistle (Salsola iberica), tumbling mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum), and peppercress (Lepidium perfoliatum, Martin and Parrish 2000).\r\n\r\nLark Sparrows in the western U.S. are generally below 2,400 m in elevation but are occasionally found up to 2,700 m (Martin and Parrish 2000).\r\n\r\nThe winter habitats of the Lark Sparrow are not well described but are believed to be similar to summer habitats except that they have a greater affinity for trees and shrubs (Martin and Parrish).  In southeastern Arizona, they can be found in desert grasslands and oak savannas (Bock and Bock 1998).  In Mexico, they have been observed in a variety of habitats including grassy coastal plains, weedy overgrown fallow fields near urbanized developments, semiopen arid thorn scrub, and pine-oak forest with sparse grass and trees that reached up to 15 m in height (Martin and Parrish 2000).\r\n\r\nN.
