Suitable ecosystems include alpine and subalpine meadows; sagebrush flats; mixed brush and grass; pastures; croplands; wet meadows; perennial or annual grassland; open, grassy stands of bitterbrush and sagebrush; meadows in yellow pine, red fir, lodgepole, and northern juniper woodland forests; and open stands of many wooded and chaparral habitats with grassy understories (Ingles 1965, NatureServe 2015, Zeiner et al. 2008).  Rocky and wooded habitats will be used if they are adjacent to inhabitat open areas (Zeiner et al. 2008).  In Little Valley, NV (Sierra Nevada), \"population was concentrated along stream banks, in adjacent grassy meadows, and sandy and rocky areas immediately bordering the meadows\u201d (Loehr and Risser 1977).  On the west slope of the Sierra Nevadas, the species is \u201crestricted to high mountain habitats, primarily meadows and early successional stages of red fir, and lodgepole pine forests\u201d and requires \u201cforest openings with friable soils for burrowing\u201d (Verner and Bos 1980).  Reported elevational ranges are 1500-3000 m  (4900 ft to 9800 ft) on the east side of the Sierra Nevadas; 4850 feet (1478 m) along Carson River south of Minden, to at least 9000 feet (2743 m) (Hall 1946); and range 550 - 3020 m (Jenkins & Eshelman 1984).
