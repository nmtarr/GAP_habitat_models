This scarce resident of humid coastal forests is found in redwood, Douglas-fir, and riparian forests. Found from sea level to 1100m (3500ft) in Oregon. Found in mature, coastal forests, preferring the vicinity of small, clear streams, with dense alder and other deciduous trees and shrubs. Occupies the habitat from ground surface to canopy, feeding in all layers, and nesting on the ground. White-footed voles often are found near logs and in brush when on the ground ([quoted from Brylski et al. CA WHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In Oregon, this species has been anecdotally associated with streamside thickets of alder, salmonberry, vine maple, and other riparian vegetation and mossy rocks within mature Douglas fir forest (Verts and Carraway 1998). However, Voth et al. (1983) suggested streamside associations are the result of tendencies to forage on leaves of riparian vegetation. More recently, A. albipes has been found to be more abundant in deciduous forest followed in order by conifer-shrub, sapling-pole conifer, old-growth conifer, and sawtimber conifer (Gomez 1992).\r\nFrom NatureServe:\r\nThis vole has been found along small, alder-lined streams in redwood forest. Very small clearings, created by fallen timber, and supporting herbaceous growth may be important habitat. In the southern Cascade Range of western Oregon, encounters with this species were correlated less with distance to water than with basal area and density of alder (Alnus rubra) and percent cover of hazel (Corylus cornuta v. californica) (Manning et al. 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWFVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF23010", "scientific_name": "Arborimus albipes", "ITIS_TSN": "180352", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102121", "common_name": "White-footed Vole"}}
