Wet meadows and marshy areas are population strongholds for the species. But, it can be found in swamps, salt marshes, grassy areas, woodland clearings, along wet ditches, and the open edges of lakes and streams. (Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Other habitats include hydric hammocks, swamps, and freshwater marshes and meadows (Wolfe 1982). In southeastern Texas, this species is common on dikes and levees created along the coastal marshes, while inland the use marshes, and moist meadows (Schmildy 2004).\r\nThe O. p. natator subspecies (Key Oryzomys, Key rice rat or Silver rice rat) is known to occupy mangrove, saltmarsh, saltmarsh transition communities and occasionally freshwater marshes of the Lower Keys includiing Big Pine, Howe, Water, Big Torch, Middle Torch, Summerland, Cudjoe, Ramrod, Upper Sugraloaf, Lower Sugarloaf, Saddlebunch, and Raccoon Key (Goodyear 1987, USFWS 1999, Mitchell 1996, Perry 2006, USFWS 2008).
