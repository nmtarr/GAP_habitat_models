Unlike other North American moles, Condylura cristata prefers areas of poor drainage, including both coniferous and deciduous forests, clearings, wet meadows, marshes and peatlands. Condylura cristata also inhabits the banks of streams, lakes and ponds, into which it ventures for food. Although it prefers wet areas, this species has been found in dry meadows as far as 400 m from water. Condylura cristata can be found along the coast and is known from elevations up to 1676 m in the Great Smoky Mountains. (Baker, 1983; Hamilton, 1931; Kurta, 1995; Lyon, 1936).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nStar-nosed moles inhabit moist fields, meadows, woods, marshy areas and other low, swampy places. They are semi-aquatic and prefer damp, loose soils and are generally absent from heavy clay and stony or gravelly soil. Their tunnels usually border streams, swamps, marshes, and some of the burrows lead directly into the water (Brown 1997). They are more dependent on water in the winter when the ground is frozen. They occasionally occur in leaf mold on the floor of dense forests. Nests are usually placed in a hummock, under a stump or log, in humus among rotten tree roots, or in other areas above high water, often near a stream.  Gestation lasts about 45 days. Parturition occurs in spring or early summer. Litter size is 3-7 (average 5-6) with one litter per year. They are sexually mature in 10 months. From Trani et al.: \"The star-nosed mole is typically associated with moist, swampy habitats such as fens, bogs, seeps, and streambanks with heavy leaf litter in both forested and early successional communities. In the southern Appalachians, it is found in mesic forest cover types including northern hardwood, cove hardwood, and white pine-eastern hemlock (Pinus strobus-Tsuga canadensis) communities around streams\r\nand low wet sites. In the Coastal Plain, it generally occurs in saturated wetlands, pocosins, and forested floodplain cover types, although it also has been reported in an upland longleaf pine (P. palustris) habitat (McCay et al. 1999).\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSNMOx", "ELCode": "AMABB05010", "scientific_name": "Condylura cristata", "ITIS_TSN": "179964", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102048", "common_name": "Star-nosed Mole"}}
