This species is reported as widely distributed in the southeastern United States and being exclusive to the Appalachian Highlands (Garrett and Barker 1987; Hoffman 1990). This species is only limited in the east at the higher elevations of the Blue Ridge Mountains (Lannoo 2005). Considered the most common frog in Florida, ubiquitous in Alabama, and persistent in Tennessee (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999; Lannoo 2005).\r\nFound in all types of shallow bodies of water to include freshwater habitats and even some brackish marshes along the coast. Moves far from water during the summer when weeds and other vegetation provide shelter (Conant and Collins 1998). Juvenile habitat is described to be wetter than adults (Lannoo 2005). Breeding occurs all year in southern locations and can be found in any type of freshwater environment, but also brackish marshes (Behler and King 1979). Reportedly occurring at salinity levels of 2.14 salt water in North Carolina (Lannoo 2005). Movement away from water has been documented to occur for feeding during the summer via shade and shelter provided by the vegetation in fields, sod lands, and pastures (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSLFRx", "ELCode": "AAABH01220", "scientific_name": "Lithobates sphenocephalus", "ITIS_TSN": "775116", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104396", "common_name": "Southern Leopard Frog"}}
