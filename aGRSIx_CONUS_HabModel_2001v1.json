They are always aquatic although they can withstand temporary drying of their habitat by burrowing and are capable of moving overland to other nearby aquatic sites.  They are most frequently encountered in muddy, weed-choked water and require a location with a soft substrate for burrowing.  They are partial to water hyacinth (Carr and Goin 1955).  The adults are generally found in 2-3 feet of water and the juveniles in 6-12 inches (Duellman and Schwartz 1958).  Their habitat is similar to that of the lesser siren, however they may utilize river margins in larger, more open water bodies to a greater extent. They lay a clutch of about 500 eggs in water in small clusters on bottom in February-March.  Hatching occurs in April-May.  They are paedomorphic.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGRSIx", "ELCode": "AAAAG02020", "scientific_name": "Siren lacertina", "ITIS_TSN": "775942", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106536", "common_name": "Greater Siren"}}
