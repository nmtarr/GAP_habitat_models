All wooded habitats, most commonly riparian aspen, ponderosa pine forests (Andrews and Righter 1992). Also other coniferous forests and Gambel oak shrublands (Andrews and Righter 1992). Common summer resident in wooded areas of both mountains and lowlands in Utah (Hayward et al. 1976). Affinity for open shrubby woodland (Johnson 1998). Benefits from fragmenting of large forests (Johnson 1998). In western plains, found in wooded areas around water or in farmyards or residential areas with trees and shrubs (Johnson 1998). In western foothills and mountains, found in deciduous or mixed deciduous-coniferous woodlands in canyons or riparian areas, in ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, pinyon-juniper, oak and walnut woodlands, aspen groves, and at edges or in clear-cut or thinned areas of denser montane coniferous forests (Johnson 1998). Frequents edges of woodlands, open forests, clearings, swampy woodlands, orchards, farmlands, surburan gardens (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Summer resident in dense brush and fallen trees from Transition zone to timberline in all mountains possessing forests in Arizona (Phillips et al. 1964). Winters in better-vegetated areas of lower Sonoran zone of southwestern Arizona and lower Colorado Valley (Phillips et al. 1964). In Utah, preferred habitats for the species often include open and semi-open brushy areas such as agricultural lands (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). House wrens often live in association with humans (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). Aspen was used more often than other habitats by House wrens (Warkentin and Reed 1999). In California, this species prefers deciduous thickets and chapparal, montane riparian, and valley foothill hardwood habitats (Grinnell and Miller 1944, Garrett and Dunn 1981).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nIn the East, known to occur primarily at or near edges of deciduous forests and in open woodlands\u2014e.g., wooded swamps, recently burned pocosins, savannas, city parks, and residential areas with trees (quoted directly from Johnson 1998). House wrens are fairly common in the mountains (Simpson 1992). They breed in the coastal plain south to Rocky Mount and in the piedmont south to Wake and Mecklenburg Counties (Potter et al. 1980). Breeding habitat generally consists of open brushlands with or without some woodland cover in scrub and secondary-growth (including coastal scrublands, early successional hardwoods, dense thickets with or without cover, and Florida scrublands, including sand pine). Also inhabits forest edge with a well developed understory, hedgerows, and brushy areas in farmlands (Hunter 1990). Frequents tangles of vines, brush heaps, undergrowth, and hedgerows in either open or wooded country. Use habitat on or within woodland borders, or old apple orchards where old trees occur or in parks and gardens where there is suitable nest boxes (Anderson 1981). Nests are placed  in semi-open brushy areas and early successional habitats (Simpson 1992) including open forests, thickets, towns, gardens, parks, orchards, woodlots, and stream margins (Kaufman 1996). In Tennessee, most nesting birds were found in residential areas providing shade trees, shrubs, and mowed lawns (Nicholson 1997). They nest in a variety of cavities. Examples include a natural tree cavity, an old woodpecker hole, a bird house, the space between logs in a cabin, between the studs of a garage wall (Nicholson 1997) and inside an old hiking boot left outdoors (Dellinger, pers. Obs.). Forages on the ground and by gleaning foliage (Ehrlich et al. 1988).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn western plains, found exclusively in wooded areas around water, or in farmyards or residential areas with trees and shrubs. In western foothills and mountains, found in deciduous or mixed deciduous-coniferous woodlands in canyons and riparian areas, in open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) parklands, in pi\u00f1on-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus), oak, and walnut (Juglans) woodlands, up to =3,000 m in aspen (Populus) groves, and at edges or in clear-cut or thinned areas of denser montane coniferous forests (quoted directly from Johnson 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bHOWRx", "ELCode": "ABPBG09010", "scientific_name": "Troglodytes aedon", "ITIS_TSN": "178541", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105321", "common_name": "House Wren"}}
