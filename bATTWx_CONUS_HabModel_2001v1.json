This species is closely associated with spruce forests (Bock and Bock 1974) but they will use forests that are composed of other coniferous species as well.  Nests are placed in the trunks of white-bark pine (P. albicaulis), lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, tamarack, western larch, black spruce, Engelmann spruce, Douglas fir, subalpine fir, white fir (A. concolor), western red cedar, quaking aspen, balsam poplar (P. balsamifera), birch, and alder (Alnus sp.) snags and trees (Leonard 2001).  They often inhabit moist to swampy areas including forested wetlands and riparian forests (Leonard 2001).   Alhough this species is generally non-migratory, there are some populations that migrate to lower elevations during winter, and irruptive movements sometimes occur during winters.        \r\n\r\nIn the western United States, American Three-toed Woodpeckers use dense, coniferous forests, and are associated with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pines (NatureServe 2009).  They may become temporarily abundant during and after forest outbreaks, generally uncommon and inconspicuous (Bock and Bock 1974).  Some studies of habitat preferences in this region have suggested a preference for mature, unlogged forests while others have indicated a preference for disturbed (fire) areas (Leonard 2001, NatureServe 2009).   Summer resident of the Sandia Mountains of New Mexico where it breeds in spruce-fir forests (Tatschl 1967).  Found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona (Franzreb and Ohmart 1978).  In New Mexico, found in the greatest numbers in the heavy forests in the Sangre de Cristo mountains (Ligon 1961).     \r\n\r\nIn the eastern United States, this species is more closely associated with wet areas, although it is not found exclusively in them.  It prefers coniferous forest, primarily spruce and balsam fir, and is found less frequently in mixed forests and occasionally in willow thickets along streams. It also uses high elevation aspen groves, bogs, and swamps (NatureServe 2009).  In Michigan and Vermont, associated with black spruce, tamarack, and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) swamps.  A study in northern Maine only found the species in a mixed-hardwood old-growth forest (Leonard 2001).\r\n\r\nAmerican Three-toed Woodpeckers are found from 1,300 m to 2,750 m in the western U.S. and from 360 m to 1,250 m in the eastern U.S. (Leonard 2001).\r\n\r\nIn the winter, this species occupies that same habitat as it does during the breeding season except that it occupies more open areas in winter, and it is often found in urban areas during irruptions (Leonard 2001).
