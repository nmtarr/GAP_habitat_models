It in montane mixed coniferous forests, coniferous forest, montane shrublands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, oak woodland, interior chaparral, tundra, juniper savannah, and agricultural land (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  N. mexicana should be found in virtually all New Mexico mountains and occurs in the Rincon Mountains of Arizona (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Cockrum 1960).  When the species occurs with N. albigula it takes the more mesic sites (Thompson et al. 1996).  N. mexicana is a food generalist (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It eats choke cherry, winter-fat, snowberry, currant, oak, rabbitbrush, sagebrush, juniper, ponderosa pine, skunkbrush, mountain-mahogany, and yucca (Cornely and Baker 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is a rock dweller and usually nests in rocky slopes, rock outcrops, and cliffs (Cornely and Baker 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The elevational range in the southwest is 305-2,896m (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996). N. mexicana occurs in the mountains of eastern Arizona, as well as the Hualapai Mountains and Prescott National Forest (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in southwestern, central, and southeastern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs across most of New Mexico except the Llano Estacado (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It is present only in southeastern Utah (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMEWOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF08070", "scientific_name": "Neotoma mexicana", "ITIS_TSN": "180375", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102682", "common_name": "Mexican Woodrat"}}
