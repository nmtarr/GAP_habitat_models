The species is only known from that location and three other places in the vicinity (Chippindale et al. 1993). Individuals occupy spring outflows fed by the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer. The species appears to be mainly surface dwelling, but may also occupy subterranean habitat (Chippindale et al. 1993). This species appears to dwell in surface waters at depths from a few centimeters to five meters (Green et al. 2013).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBSPSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05170", "scientific_name": "Eurycea sosorum", "ITIS_TSN": "550247", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104730", "common_name": "Barton Springs Salamander"}}
