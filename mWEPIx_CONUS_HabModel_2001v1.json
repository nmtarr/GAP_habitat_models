"Recently renamed the Canyon Bat (Parastrellus hesperus), the Western Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus hesperus) is found in the Western U.S. in arid locations near water.  It occurs in western and southeastern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003); western and northern Nevada; and along the southwestern and southeastern borders (Bat Conservation International 2002); but has not been found in northcentral or extreme northwestern Utah (Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003).  It occurs nearly throughout New Mexico (Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003, Frey 2004).  It has been documented in the following mountain ranges, among others: Dog Mountains, Animas Mountains, San Mateo Mountains, Guadalupe Mountains, Mohave Mountains, Tinajas Altas Mountains, Ajo Range, Santa Catalina Mountains, Santa Rita Mountains, Tumacacori Mountains, Chiricahua Mountains, Lahontan Mountains, Huachuca Mountains, Blue Range, Gold Mountain Range, Bullfrog Hills, Silver Peak Range, Sylvania Mountains, Monte Christo Range, Weepah Hills, Palmetto Mountains, Sierra Ancha, Pinaleno Mountains, Tushar, Peloncillo, Jemez, Harquahala Mountains, Florida Mountains, Castle Dome Mountains, Galiura Mountains, White Tank mountains, Henry mountains, Big Hatchet mountains.  P. hesperus is present throughout Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986, Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003). \r\n\r\nP. hesperus is primarily a desert species (Adams 2003).   It is found in arid habitats such as greasewood flats, deserts, desert scrub flats, desert mountains, rocky cliffs, canyon areas, shortgrass plains, sactan grassland, and scrub grassland along with adjacent oak savannah and woodland, and chaparral woodlands (Husar 1976, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004, NatureServe 2004, Smithsonian Mammals).  The species is associated with cliffs, canyons, and rock outcrops (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Suitable areas can be vegetated with aspen, cottonwood, willow, sycamore, western live oak, pinyon - juniper, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, Engelmann's spruce, spruce-fir, gray oak, emory oak, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, palo verde, saguaro cactus, ocotillo, winter-fat, tarbush, broom snakeweed, rubber rabbitbrush, big sagebrush, greasewood, fourwing saltbush, creosotebush, wheatgrass, sixweeks fescue, Indian ricegrass, aspen, alkali sacaton, tobosa, galleta, ricegrass, cattail, Apache plume, mesquite, and rarely in ponderosa pine forest (Husar 1976, Hoffmeister 1986, Hall 1995, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, Adams 2003, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004).  \r\n\r\nWater is a limiting factor for this species (Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004), and roosting sites are close to water sources (Findley 1987, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004).  After emerging from their roosts, they usually visit a water source (Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004, NatureServe 2004). \r\n\r\nP. hesperus roosts under loose rocks, in crevices and caves, and also uses burrows of animals in open desert scrub communities (Zeveloff 1988, Fitzgerald 1994).  It roosts and hibernates close to its summer range (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  A larger species, M. grisescens, flies a maximum distance of 6.6km to foraging sites (NatureServe 2004).  The farthest from rocky areas P. hesperus has been seen is 4 miles (Hoffmeister 1986).  \r\n\r\nThe elevational range for this species is 0-2,896m (Adams 2003, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004, NatureServe 2004).   A hibernaculum was discovered at 2,896m in Colorado (Adams 2003). \r\n\r\nP. hesperus is found active in Nevada at temperatures as low as -8 degrees Celcius and in both Nevada and Utah at temperatures close to 1-2 degrees Celsius (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, Zeveloff 1988).
