Their range in California extends from central Humboldt County into a small portion of Trinity County, then north to Siskiyou and Del Norte counties. In Oregon, the species occurs in Curry and Coos counties and eastward into the Siskiyou Mountains in Josephine County. Recent reports of the species include inland observations along West Cow Creek in the Umpqua River watershed located in southwest Douglas County (Lannoo 2005; Green et al. 2013). Breeding sites are presumed to be the forest floor of mature to late-seral forest stands; preferred egg deposition sites are probably subterranean cavities in association with unconsolidated talus to include other hard substrates (Lannoo 2005). Adults are generally found in association with talus or rocky substrates (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Ollivier and Welsh 1999) and woody debris near rocky substrates (Welsh and Lind 1991).\r\nThis species occurs in area once protected from resource extraction which threatens the late-seral and mature forests (Welsh and Lind 1995).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aDNSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12050", "scientific_name": "Plethodon elongatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173655", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104301", "common_name": "Del Norte Salamander"}}
