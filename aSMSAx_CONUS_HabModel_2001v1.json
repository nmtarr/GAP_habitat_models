These springs have been heavily modified by humans to construct a small lake. More recently, San Marcos salamanders occupy this lake and upstream the San Marcos River in springs at elevations of 174 meters (Green et al. 2013). As adults, this species is completely aquatic and is found in growths of blue algae (Lyngbya sp.), in gravel substrate, under rocks, and in the water column at water depths more than a meter.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSMSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05070", "scientific_name": "Eurycea nana", "ITIS_TSN": "173693", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106379", "common_name": "San Marcos Salamander"}}
