The best habitat appears to be a mixture of talus rock faces, alpine meadows, ridge tops, and subalpine ecotones (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Inhabits alpine and subalpine areas having steep rocky terrain (Rideout and Hoffman 1975). Mountain goats are strongly associated with topographic features including steep terrain for escape from predators such as steep slopes of broken, rocky terrain (Gross et al. 2002). Slopes of >25 degrees and >33 degrees have been used to model escape terrain for mountain goats (Gross et al. 2002). The strong association of mountain goats with steep slopes suggests escape terrain may be the most important factor influencing habitat selection by mountain goats (Gross et al. 2002). Several studies have shown that about 60% of some goat populations occupy slopes greater than 50 degrees and 10% > 60 degrees slope (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Mountain goats in Colorado are introduced; they typically do not descend past treeline or venture far from talus or rock faces (Fitzgerald et al., 1994). Primary habitats in Colorado include alpine meadows, krummholz, wind-blown fellfields, scree slopes, subalpine forest, and cliffs (Gross et al. 2002). Dominant plant species in these habitats include willows, sedges, grasses, forbs, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce and juniper (Gross et al. 2002). In Utah mountain goats are a re-introduced species that occurs in the mountain ranges in northern Utah (UDWR 2002). In Nevada this species is classified as a re-introduced species that occurs in the East Humbolt and the Ruby Mountain Ranges in northern Nevada (NDOW). In Nevada, found from 2,850m in elevation and higher (NDOW). In northern Rocky Mountains, can be found at 1500-2700m, but in Colorado seen at >4000m (Feldhamer et al. 2003). CWSD has an elevational range of 3048- 4420m.  Lower elevation from NDOW and maximum from CWSD. In some locations, mountain goat may migrate up and down mountains between summer and winter activity areas; in Montana, summer and winter ranges were a maximum of 2.2 km apart (Natureserve). Annual home range in different areas of Montana was 6-24 sq km (Natureserve).  May travel some distance to salt licks in spring and summer (Natureserve).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMOGOx", "ELCode": "AMALE02010", "scientific_name": "Oreamnos americanus", "ITIS_TSN": "180713", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104036", "common_name": "Mountain Goat"}}
