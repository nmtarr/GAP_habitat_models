Their habitat is usually associated with shallow, acidic water of longleaf or slash pine flatwoods.  They may often be encountered among the roots of floating vegetation (especially hyacinth), the muddy bottoms of pools, or in litter at the water\u2019s edge (Ashton 1988; Duellman and Schwartz 1958).  Dwarf sirens may survive periods of drought encased in dried mud.   P. striatus is regarded as including three subspecies (striatus, speniscus, and lustricolus).  The taxonomic status of the various subspecies is uncertain and further study of geographic variation in Pseudobranchus is needed (see Moler and Kezer 1993).  The Gulf Hammock subspecies (P. s. lustricolus) is possibly restricted to wetlands within a narrow strip of hydric hardwood hammock near the Gulf Coast.   P. s. spheniscus is found in low areas such as ponds in pine flatwoods (Carr and Goin 1955).   The eggs are found in water (Carr 1940).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aNDSIx", "ELCode": "AAAAG01010", "scientific_name": "Pseudobranchus striatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173738", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100328", "common_name": "Northern Dwarf Siren"}}
