When M. montanus isn't abundant, M. mogollonensis also inhabits hydrosere (water) communities (Findley et al. 1975, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs in grassy situations next to or within ponderosa pine, juniper, sagebrush, limber pine, aspen, or as high as spruce-fir (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in blackbrush, snowberry, manzanita, rose, winter-fat, rabbitbrush, sagebrush, greasewood, tamarisk, desert olive, juniper, pinyon, Apache pine, Chihuahuan pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, ponderosa pine, ponderosa pine-Gambel's oak, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, wavyleaf oak, shinnery oak, scrub oak, live oak, mahogany, fescue, grama and buffalograss, cottonwood, alder, willow, rush, bulrush, sedge, and cattail (Findley et al. 1975, Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It occurs on mountains and plateaus in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah (NatureServe 2001). Generally occurs in mountain meadows (Oliver 2005). M. mogollonensis occupies a home range from 0.02-2.7 ha (NatureServe 2001). Some were taken as low as 1159m and as high as 3506m (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996). M. mogollonensis occurs along the Mogollon Plateau, from the little Colorado River west to Prospect Valley, and in various mountain ranges in central and northern Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in southwestern Colorado around Mesa Verde and in eastern Las Animas County, though it may be more widespreadin southeastern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is present in the higher mountain ranges throughout New Mexico, except in the San Juan, Jemez, and the majority of the Sangre de Cristo mountains (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). The species occurs in Colfax and Union counties in New Mexico east of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains (Frey 2004). It occurs at Navajo Mountain in southeastern Utah (Utah GAP 1997, Oliver 2005).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, this species is known only from a location in the high Guadalpe Mountains of Culberson County. It prefers grassy openings and downed logs of yellow pine forest (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMGVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11210", "scientific_name": "Microtus mogollonensis", "ITIS_TSN": "552480", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102583", "common_name": "Mogollon Vole"}}
