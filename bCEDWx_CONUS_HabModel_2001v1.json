It is a year-round resident in parts of central-western Colorado, northern Utah, northern New Mexico (Rio Arriba county), and northwestern Nevada and a winter resident in eastern Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico (Phillips et al. 1964, Andrews and Righter 1992, Witmer et al. 1997, BISON-M). \r\n\r\nCedar Waxwings breed in open deciduous, coniferous and mixed woodlands, forest-edges, urban areas, and old-field habitats with numerous shrubs and small trees, riparian areas of deserts and grasslands, farms, orchards, conifer plantations and suburban gardens (Witmer et al. 1997).  They usually place nests on the edges of wooded areas or in isolated trees or shrubs in old fields.  Sometimes, they place nests in wooded areas but usually in a canopy gap where trees are widely spaced (Witmer 1997).  In general, Cedar Waxwings avoid forest interiors.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of Cedar Waxwings in the southwest is limited to riparian areas (Witmer et al. 1997).  In Colorado, they have a strong preference for deciduous riparian areas below 2,285 m that provide nesting shrubs and trees, fruits, and emergent aquatic insects (Andrews and Righter 1992, Witmer et al. 1997, Kingery 1998).  Cedar Waxwings breed between 24 and 2,590 m in elevation in the Southwest (Schrupp and Cade 1989, BISON-M).\r\n\r\nFruits comprise a large portion of the Cedar Waxwing\u2019s diet.  Summer foods include the fruits of serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.), strawberry (Fragaria spp.), mulberry (Morus spp.), cherries (Prunus spp.), and raspberries (Rubus spp.; Witmer 1997).  Between May and September, many Cedar Waxwings increase their consumption of arthropod prey.  These prey items include mayflies (Ephemeroptera), dragonflies (Odonata), and swarming ants (Hymenoptera) collected near streams or ponds as well as sap-feeding scale insects (Coccoidea), spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) larvae and pupae, and elm leaf beetle (Chrysomelidae) larvae and adults that they glean from vegetation (Witmer 1997).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, Cedar Waxwings utilize areas with fruit-bearing shrubs or trees, open woodlands, parks, gardens, second-growth forests, and the edges of evergreen, deciduous, and mixed forests, and they are concentrated in the southeastern Coast Plain (Andrews and Righter 1992, Witmer et al. 1997, BISON-M).  In general, most Cedar Waxwing wintering and migratory habitats are associated with the abundance of crops of wild or ornamental berries (Andrews and Righter 1992). They are attracted to regions with high densities of junipers (Juniperus spp.), frequenting habitats with cedars (Juniperus spp.) and sage scrub (California sagebrush [Artemesia californica], toyon [Photinia arbutifolia], and elderberry [Sambucus mexicana], Witmer 1997).  In the northern part of their range, mountain ash (Sorbus americana) is an important winter food.  In the southwestern U.S. they eat toyon (Photinia arbutifolia), mistletoe, madrone (Arbutus menziesi), juniper, alien honeysuckle, and peppertree (Witmer 1997).  In the desert southwest, Cedar Waxwings occur in riparian woodlands and desert washes with mistletoe and in human modified habitats planted with firethorn shrubs (Witmer et al. 1997).  N.
