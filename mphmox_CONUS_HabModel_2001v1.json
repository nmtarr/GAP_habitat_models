American Society of Mammalogits Mammalian Species No. 257:1-5."}, "habitat_description": "Southwest:\r\nR. montanus is found in interior chaparral, plains grassland, short to mid-grass prairies, desertscrub, agriculture, vegetated urban areas, and moderately grazed yucca-grassland communities on sandy soils (Best and Henry 1993, Wilkins 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It is mainly restricted to grassland (Best and Henry 1993).  In NM it becomes scarce as aridity increases and grass cover dwindles (Best and Henry 1993).  It is found in the grassland of the upper Animas Valley (Best and Henry 1993).  In AZ R. montanus lives in xeric conditions with mesquite, tumbleweeds, some grass, and usually in desertscrub or chaparral (Wilkins 1986).  It occurs among shinnery oak sand scrub, sagebrush, rabbitbrush, creosotebush, winter-fat, tarbush, ocotillo, grama and buffalograss, bluestem, cottonwood (including plains cottonwood), smooth sumac, fescue, bermudagrass, broomsedge, foxtail, Johnsongrass, paspalum, new wheat, grain sorghum, switchgrass, crimson clover, coastal bermuda, three awn, needle-and-thread, dropseed, bristlegrass, sunflower, dead Russian thistle, broomweed, prairie sand reed, and sycamore (Wilkins 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  PNV - grama \"short-grass\" and mixed \"short-grass\" (Best and Henry 1993).  It eats the seed and heads of ironweed and snow-on-the-mountain (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  R. montanus often nests under stones in pastures associated with prickly pear and some weedy species (Best and Henry 1993).  It uses pappus from low milkweed and wavy-leafed thistle in nests (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The species is more abundant on sand, sandy loam, and loam soils (Wilkins 1986).  The home range is 0.04-0.84ha (NatureServe 2003).  Elevation is as low as 84m in Texas up to 1920m in Mexico (Wilkings 1986, NatureServe 2003).  R. montanus occurs in central and southeast Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in the eastern plains of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs from Hidalgo County northeast through the central Rio Grande Valley to Colfax County and in the eastern plains (Frey 2004). Can be found in the Santa Rita mountains (Cockrum 1960).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Nebraska, the plains harvest mouse inhabits open, heavily grazed prairie, fence lines (Seabloom and Shaffer 2005), and salt marshes (Wilkins 1986, Schneider et al. 2011).  They seem to prefer vegetation from approximately 2.5-25 cm tall, less than 40% bare ground, on loamy sand soils (Wilkins 1986).  Most occurrences of the species in the state are from the Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregion (Schneider et al. 2011). In Texas, Schmidly (2004) describes habitat: \"These mice appear to prefer climax, or near climax, well-drained grassland. They also are known to occupy overgrown highway rights-of-way with mixed grasses and forbs, such as sunflowers. Other suitable habitats include hayfields, moderately grazed pastures, sagebrush habitats, riparian habitats, and abandoned fields. In Brazos County they occur most commonly in blackland prairies where the dominant vegetation is bluestem grass (Andropogon). Their nests are composed of fine grass compacted into small balls and are either in bunchgrass or just benearth the ground in their burrows.\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPHMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF02010", "scientific_name": "Reithrodontomys montanus", "ITIS_TSN": "180344", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102634", "common_name": "Plains Harvest Mouse"}}
