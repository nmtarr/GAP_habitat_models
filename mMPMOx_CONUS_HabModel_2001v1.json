It was formerly a subspecies of P. flavus. Habitat includes deserts, grasslands, shrublands, and chaparral (NatureServe 2004). This includes shortgrass prairie and desert scrubland including mesquite-grass associations (NatureServe 2004). Can occur in fallow fields and juniper savanna (NatureServe 2004). Generally requires continuous short to midgrass prairie or herbaceous cover (BISON-M 2004). Frey (1996) identified the following  associations with this species: P/J, juniper savanna, redberry juniper, sand scrub, Chihuahuan desert scrub, short grass steppe, mid-grass prairie, tall grass prairie, Chihuahuan desert grassland, lowland riparian, arroyo riparian, barren lands, urban, and playa. In Texas, Schmidly (2004) describes habitat: \"In southern Texas, these tiny mice are most common on sandy soils where vegetation is sparse or at least short. In Trans-Pecos Texas, they are more common on stony and gravelly soils covered with sparse vegetation. They seem to have difficulty in traveling through heavy vegetation, and if forced into grass several centimeters high, their progress is materially impeded. Near Oiltown, Texas, they were especially common in stands of low Bermuda grass on the shoulders of the highway where they were gathering seeds. These pocket mice are found in soil substrates ranging from sandy, deep soils to clayey, shallow soils.\" They occur up to elevations of 1830 meters and appear to be limited by suitable habitat at upper elevations in southwestern Texas and can be abundant in grazed pastures and grasslands (Wilson and Ruff 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMPMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFD01190", "scientific_name": "Perognathus merriami", "ITIS_TSN": "552488", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104376", "common_name": "Merriam's Pocket Mouse"}}
