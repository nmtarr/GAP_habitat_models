It is found in alpine and subalpine grassland, alpine talus slides, sage plains, forested woodland bordered by sandstone ledges, the edges of spruce-fir forest, tundra, and juniper savannah (Findley et al. 1975, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). PNV - mixed \"short-grass\", Great Basin Desertscrub, low, semi-arid sagebrush and greasewood desert, through brushy ravines (Thompson et al. 1996). In Colorado, the species is associated with clearings or subclimax grassland (Thompson et al. 1996). It is strongly associated with shrubs at forest edges, disturbed areas, and forest ecotones (Thompson et al. 1996). The Penasco subspecies is found in more open situations, including fencerows bordering agriculture fields and open stands of trees (Thompson et al. 1996). Shrublands and forest clearings are necessary for adult feeding (Thompson et al. 1996). T. minimus eats Vaccinium berries and strawberries, fungi, Russian thistle, currants, prickly pear, thistle, and fleabane (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Hall 1995). It eats the seeds of gilia, bitterroot, sedges, violet, evening primrose, common wild geranium, and grass (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It eats the flowers of alpine parsley, dandelion, and paintbrush (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The home range varies from 0.2 ha to 1.6 ha (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, NatureServe 2001). Maximum distances between captures was 143 to 413 m (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). T. minimus is most frequently found on slopes less than 22 degrees, but may be found on slopes even greater than 67 degrees (Sullivan 1985, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). The elevation is from 1,220-3,900m (Hall 1995, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Elevation: up to 2800 m. in Nevada, up to 3000 m. in New Mexico, up to 3900 in Colorado (Jezkova 2005). The species retreats to burrows in cold weather (Thompson et al. 1996). T. minimus occurs on the Kaibab Plateau, Chuska-Lukachukai Mountains, and White Mountains in Arizona (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in the western two-thirds of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species is present in the northern two-thirds of Nevada except for the low western valleys, probably due to the lack of sagebrush in them (Hall 1995). The chipmunk is found in the Sacramento, Chuska, San Juan, Jemez, Sangre de Cristo, and Sandia mountains in New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). The species occurs throughout Utah (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997). It is found in the Sierra Blanca, Sacramento Mountains, Sandia Mountains, Santa Fe Mountains, Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Jemez Mountains, Tunitcha Mountains, White Mountains, San Juan Mountains, Lukachukai Mountains, Blue Range,  Wasatch Range, Gallinas Mountains, Chuska Mountains, Granite Range in Washoe County, Humboldt Range, East Humboldt Range, Shoshone Mountains, Toquima Range, Monitor Range, Quinn Canyon Mountains, Kawich Mountains, Schell Creek Range, Silver Peak Range, and the Tunitcha Mountains. In California, this species is fairly common in sagebrush, bitterbrush, and various Great Basin shrub habitats. It may also inhabit the brushy understory of open Jeffrey pine and pinyon-juniper areas as well as alpine dwarf-shrub habitats in higher elevation mountain environments ([Harris et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Washington, this species inhabits shrubsteppe or open forest habitats including sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), antelope bitterbrush, and greasewood and are rarely found in grasslands or closed forest. Most habitat use is adjacent to shrubsteppe and/or open forest and may also utilize low density urban and open space when adjacent to shrubsteppe. Alpine meadows are not within T. minimus' range in the state of Washington (WHCWG 2010, Dalquest 1948, Johnson and Cassidy 1997, Larrison 1947, Feldhamer 1979). In Oregon, T. minimus occurs in shrubsteppe and occasionally open forest edges of ponderosa pine and shrubsteppe. They will also occur in aspen groves with rocky outcrops, sagebrush, greaswood and within heavy soils (such as clays) and avoid grasslands and marshes (Verts and Carraway 1998, Hansen 1956, Feldhamer 1979).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\n\"In northern Minnesota, T. minimus was associated with 'recently logged or burned areas, in disturbed habitats around campsites and resorts, and along the rocky shore of Lake Superior\u2019 (Timm 1975). The species also was taken in early seral stands of black spruce (Picea mariana), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) but was replaced by T. striatus in stands of mature pine. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, T. minimus occurs 'in dense upland forest, hardwoods and conifers alike, but it also frequents swamps of white cedar, black spruce, alder, and leatherleaf, as well as rocky and sandy shores, recently burned or cutover areas, rocky  mountain-tops, cleared lands, and openings in the forest grown up to brambles and brush' (Manville 1949). However, in the same region, habitats with good horizontal visibility, medium to dense brush piles, and open canopies were occupied significantly more than habitats with other characteristics (Reilly 1971).\" (quoted directly from Verts and Carrway 2001).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLECHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02020", "scientific_name": "Tamias minimus", "ITIS_TSN": "180195", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103812", "common_name": "Least Chipmunk"}}
