Range has recently expanded southward, including down the Rocky Mountains (Bowyer et al. 2003). It occurs in the SWReGAP region in Utah and Colorado (Bowyer et al. 2003). Moose were not present in Utah until the early 1900s  but by 1947 a resident herd had naturally become established in the Uinta mountains from Wyoming or Idaho populations (Wilson 1971; UDWR 2000); expansion may be due to an increase in numbers of beaver and their creation of marshes (Zeveloff 1988). Moose numbers have steadily increased in Utah and the species is now well established in mountainous areas in the northern half of the state (UDWR 2000). Transplants into other areas of Utah have had limited success but it has been introduced as far south as the Fishlake Plateau (Sevier Co.) (UDWR 2000). Wandering individuals were known to have naturally occurred in north-central Colorado (Routt, Blanco, and Larimer Counties) but no breeding population was established (Lechleitner 1969; Armstrong 1972) until introduced into the state in 1978 (Fitzgerald 1994). Introduced as far south as the Grand Mesa area and around Creede (Mineral Co.) in Colorado (CDOW 2004). Has recently been observed in extreme northern New Mexico, just south of the Colorado border (Stuart, pers. Comm., 2005). Note that moose are not known to occur as far south into New Mexico as depicted by the SWReGAP range map; this is an artifact of using HUCs to delineate the range. Usually associated with riparian areas, beaver ponds, and lakes with willows (Salix spp.) present; also found in subalpine meadows, deciduous (such as aspen Populus tremuloides or birch Betula spp.), mixed conifierous-deciduous forests, and  forests of spruce or fir (Peek 1974; Knowlton 1960; Bowyer et al. 2003). Coniferous forests often used for resting and escape cover and for thermal reasons in both summer and winter. Moose in Utah were previously thought to be limited to willow habitat (Wilson 1971) but they also frequent aspen forests and drier, montane shrublands with Gamble oak (Quercus gambelii), serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis), or chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) (UDWR 2000). In Colorado, moose were introduced into areas with willow and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). No detailed habitat studies available from the SWReGAP region. In Montana, moose moved down to willow bottoms in winter; in summer were in subalpine meadows and adjacent willow patches, using coniferous forest as resting and escape cover (Knowlton 1960). In north-central Idaho, grand fir (Abies grandis)-Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) were critical winter habitat (Pierce and Peek 1984) and they fed on Pacific yew, menziesia (Mensiesia ferruginea), Sitka alder (Alnus sinuate), mountain maple (Acer glabrum), and Scouler\u2019s willow (Salix scouleriana) (Pierce 1984). Favors early successional vegetation resulting from disturbance, such as areas that have been burned, logged, flooded, or manipulated by beavers (Franzmann 1981; Bowyer et al. 2003). Heterogenous areas probably ideal where mature coniferous stands offer cover adjacent to the more open, deciduous vegetation used for food (Puttock et al. 1996). The moose occurs at higher elevations in the SWReGAP region. It occurs from 2400 m to 3048 m in Colorado (Schrupp and Cade 1989); however, it may be found lower in winter because the Colorado Division of Wildlife (CDOW 2004) specified a winter elevation range in the Grand Mesa area of 2130 m to 2895 m. Often migrates to lower elevations in winter (Franzmann 1981; Pierce and Peek 1984; Bowyer et al. 2003). Moose have been found as low as the foothills (approximately 1500 m) along the Wasatch front of Utah, even into residential neighborhoods (Zeveloff 1988). Adapted to cold temperatures and snow and is susceptible to heat stress at temperatures above 20 deg C (68 F); not generally found in areas that lack shade or access to water in lakes or rivers (Franzmann 1981; Peterson 1999). Not restricted by snow unless deeper than 90 cm (Franzmann 1981). Thought to be limited in Utah (and probably throughout southern extent of range in North America) by habitat, summer climate, and/or elevation (UDWR 2000; Bowyer et al. 2003).  Moose-vehicle collisions are a problem across its range (Franzmann 1981) but do not seem to be a common occurrence in Utah (UDWR 2000). Seems to tolerate low levels of development (Schneider and Wasel 2000).\r\n\r\nNorthwest/Great Plains:\r\nWyoming Game and Fish species account describes habitat: \"Wyoming moose occupy habitats within the state that are generally similar to, but somewhat drier than, those within the rest of the species\u2019 range in North America. Wyoming moose use Engelmann spruce, Douglas and subalpine fir, and lodgepole pine forests plus associated habitats. The associated habitats include lacustrine and palustrine riparian communities, especially those dominated by willow; mixed mountain shrub communities; and aspen. Wyoming moose generally summer at higher elevation in conifer forests and winter in willow habitats and deciduous habitats generally adjacent conifer stands. Movement from summer range to winter range typically involves descending to lower elevations where the snow pack is shallower and mobility is greater.\" In Montana, summer habitats include swamp, and mountain meadows, while winter habitats consist of willow river flats, and mature conifer forest (MT Natural Heritage Program 2016).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\nIn Minnesota, moose utilize successional forests and woodlots along with their typical riparian and lake margin habitats (Minnesota DNR 2016). In Michigan, this species inhabits boreal forests with shrubby undergrowth, cedar swamps, marshes, and riparian areas with willow-alder thickets (Michigan DNR 2016).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMOOSx", "ELCode": "AMALC03010", "scientific_name": "Alces americanus", "ITIS_TSN": "180703", "Global_SEQ_ID": "792092", "common_name": "Moose"}}
