This species is regarded as a benthic species that burrows in or using soil, ground litter, and decaying logs. \r\n\r\nPrimarily found in low gradient creeks, and shallow water pools, this species also ventures into riparian zones such as herbaceous and forested wetlands. Preferred habitat characteristics include non-flowing fresh or brackish water, soft bottoms, wet meadows, and dense vegetative cover. Often found on terrestrial sites up to 135 meters from wetlands during periods of inactivity (Buhlmann and Gibbons 2001). Nesting sites are found in open areas of soft soil in close proximity to water. Other sites for nesting are muskrat tunnels, ground litter, and cover provided by vegetation (Ernst and Barbour 1972).\r\n\r\n*Mud turtles are considered sedentary but sometimes also move many kilometers across wetland and upland habitats to find suitable nesting areas or isolated ponds or wetlands (Natureserve.org).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEMDTx", "ELCode": "ARAAE01050", "scientific_name": "Kinosternon subrubrum", "ITIS_TSN": "173763", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106169", "common_name": "Eastern Mud Turtle"}}
