Will sometimes nest in live oaks (Watt and Willoughby, 1999). Needs scattered trees with nearby water (DeGraaf et al., 1991). Summer resident of the Sandia Mountains in New Mexico, common in ponderosa pine community (Tatchl, 1967).  Also found in riparian areas in southeastern Arizona, including areas dominated by velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), big-tooth maple (Acer grandintatum), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), Arizona walnut (Juglans major) and willow (Salix spp.) (Strong and Bock, 1990).  In Nevada, this species is widespread in the summer, but uncommon (Alcorn, 1988). In Arizona, this species is a fairly common summer resident in deciduous trees and weedy fields of the Sonoran zones (Phillips et al., 1964). Usually associated with pinyon-juniper in Colorado; also narrowleaf and broadleaf cottonwoods (Kingery, 1988).\r\nIn San Benito Mtns., where species has increased in abundance during past 50 yr: open pine groves of Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi), digger pine (P. sabiniana), and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens); these stands are also associated with \u201cshrubby species forming a conspicuous chaparral element\u201d (Johnson and Cicero 1985: 1). Common breeding resident on Palos Verdes Peninsula west of Los Angeles, an area mostly residential and suburban containing mainly introduced ornamental shrubs and trees, although relict vegetation of lemonade berry (Rhus integrifolia), California sagebrush (Artemisia california), buckwheat (Eriogonum spp.), sage (Salvia spp.), black mustard (Brassica nigra), and prickly pear (Opuntia occidentalis) persists in gullies and canyons (Bradley 1980). The variety of habitats in California alone attests to habitat adaptability of Lesser Goldfinch. In Arizona, in deciduous trees and brush, especially willows (Salix spp.) and cottonwoods (Populus spp.), sometimes in live oaks (Quercus spp.; Monson and Phillips 1981), usually in brushy or riparian woodlands (Davis and Russell 1984); along Colorado River, also breeds in citrus (Citrus spp.) orchards and in towns (Rosenberg et al. 1991). In se. Arizona, found breeding in riparian communities with Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), Fremont cottonwood, Arizona walnut (Juglans major), box elder (Acer negundo), willow, seepwillow (Baccharis salicifolia), hackberry (Celtis pallida), alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana), Apache pine (Pinus latifolia), Chihuahua pine (Pinus chihuahuana), silverleaf oak (Quercus hypoleucoides), and manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens; Goldwasser 1987). In Utah, found mostly in deciduous trees in valleys, cities, and lower canyon floors (Behle et al. 1985); in Nevada, widespread but not common in riparian areas (Alcorn 1988). Throughout Great Basin, found mainly in valleys nesting near open terrain where weed patches and water are available (Ryser 1985). In New Mexico, widely distributed throughout the state where weed seeds are available, particularly those of wild sunflowers (Helianthus spp.; Ligon 1961), and in riparian habitats along Gila River associated with Fremont cottonwood, box elder, and Goodding willow (Salix gooddingii; Baltosser 1986). Earlier reports (Bailey 1928, and repeated in Gross 1968) stressed the oddity of breeding limited to no lower than 1,500 m in New Mexico, with most of lowlands uninhabited (quoted directly from Watt and Willoughby 1999).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nWide variety of habitats throughout range. In Oregon, found in oak foothills, riparian woods, brushy areas, and residential areas (Gilligan et al. 1994). In California, common in oak woodlands, open oak-conifer forests, light forest interspersed with open or brushy areas, pi\u00f1on-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus) woodlands, riparian woodlands and thickets, chaparral, desert oases, ranch and farmyards, and rural, urban, and suburban parks and gardens (as long as there is a good water source); avoids dense montane and subalpine forests (Small 1994). One habitat of documented abundance was Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and black willow (Salix nigra) woodland of Sacramento River floodplain (Gaines 1974). In Colorado, breeds in riparian forests, shrublands (mostly Gambel oak [Quercus gambelii Nutt.]), and ponderosa pine forests (Andrews and Righter 1992), common in lower Transition Zone, where scrub oaks merge with ponderosa pines (Bailey and Niedrach 1965)(quoted directly from Watt and Willoughby 1999).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, common to fairly common in Trans-Pecos and Edwards Plateau regions in lightly wooded areas near water; frequently in cottonwoods (Populus deltoides), sycamores (Platanus occidentalis), and baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) along stream margins, mesquite (Prosopis spp.), oak and juniper shrubs on slopes, and weedy patches of composites (Simmons 1925, Oberholser 1974)(quoted directly from Watt and Willoughby 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bLEGOx", "ELCode": "ABPBY06090", "scientific_name": "Carduelis psaltria", "ITIS_TSN": "179234", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101583", "common_name": "Lesser Goldfinch"}}
