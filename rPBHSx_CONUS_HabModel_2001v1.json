The elevational range is estimated from localities near sea level up to 2130 meters (Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits desert grassland, sandhills, riparian zones, thornbrush woodland, plains, and rocky canyons. To a lesser extent, habitat also includes dumps and vacant fields (Degenhardt et al. 1996; Hammerson 1999; Stebbins 2003; Tennant 1998; Werler and Dixon 2000). During the day, seeks cover under rocks or underground. By night, it travels in open, sparsely vegetated areas. This species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and ground litter (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nAssociated with plant communities of thornbrush in desert grasslands.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rPBHSx", "ELCode": "ARADB35050", "scientific_name": "Tantilla nigriceps", "ITIS_TSN": "174283", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103317", "common_name": "Plains Black-headed Snake"}}
