Occupies old orchards, wooded pastures and riparian corridors, wooded swamps, parks, cemeteries, and other urban areas with numerous large shade trees. Favors isolated woodlots, second-growth woodlands, wooded hedgerows, and selectively cut woodlands over continuous and closed-canopy forest. Favors mesic to wet forests over dry forests, and avoids boreal forest. Fitzpatrick (1980: 48) noted that Myiarchus species generally \u201cfavor leafy micro-habitats with high light intensity, including scrub, forest openings and subcanopy, and river or lake margins.\u201d (quoted directly from Lanyon 1997).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nIn all seasons they can be found in: medium-growth to somewhat open woods and forests, hardwoods, mixed woods, or pines, wooded residential areas, but generally scarce in dense forests (Hamel 1992).  Research on canopy selection and flight length indicates a preference for open canopies where unhampered foraging flights can occur (Via 1979). Preferred perches are tall trees, but may also be found on utility lines and short shrub-like growth in recent clearcuts (Via 1979).  Reported to use: FORESTED WETLANDS (including southern riverine forests, southern mixed hardwood swamp forests, bald cypress, pocosin, Carolina bays, and Appalachian riverine forests); UPLAND BROADLEAF WOODLANDS (oak-hickory, southenh hardwoods at low elevations, and Appalachian cove forests at mid elevations); and MIXED BROADLEAF-NEEDLELEAF WOODLANDS (pine-oak and pine-white cedar at low elevations, red cedar-hemlock-eastern white pine-mixed deciduous at mid elevation and red spruce-beech-maple at high elevations). All above woodlands at low and mid elevation (AL). Also inhabits Pine woodlands (Coastal Plain and Piedmont: longleaf-slash, loblolly-shortleaf. Piedmont, Ridge and Valley, Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau:  virginia pine, shortleaf pine). Subtropical woodlands including mangroves (Hunter-AL).  Prefers open woodlands, cypress swamps, farmyards, shade trees of city streets (AL).  Generally in open deciduous or mixed woodlands and edges of clearings, seldom in coniferous woods.  Occupies old orchards, wooded pastures and riparian corridors, wooded swamps, parks, cemeteries, golf courses and other urban areas with large trees.  Favors isolated woodlots, second-growth woodlands, wooded hedgerows, and selectively cut woodlands over continuous and closed-canopy forest and generally favors mesic to wet forests over dry forests, and avoids boreal forests (AL). Prefers medium to mature forests in moderately open woodlands (Potter et al 1980, Simpson 1992). They breed in deciduous (mainly), mixed, or pine woodland or somewhat open forest (Hamel et al. 1982, Hamel 1992), parks, orchards, wooded residential areas, areas of scattered trees in cultivated regions, clearings and edges of wooded areas, and swamps. Frequents upper levels of trees.  Also inhabits edges of clearings,  wooded pastures, old orchards, riparian corridors, parks, cemeteries, and other urban areas with numerous shade trees (Lanyon 1997). Often favors drier habitats as well (Potter et al 1980).  Found in all parts of North Carolina except in the higher mountains (Hamel 1992, Potter et al 1980).\r\nGreat-crested Flycatchers forages from the crevices of tree bark, fence posts, and haystacks before trees are in full foliage (Layton 1997) and selects high perches (Anderson-AL).  During the breeding season, they mainly forage on insects, either hawking them from a branch in the canopy,  gleaning from the foliage while hovering, or drops from a perch to the ground on prey (Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996, Lanyon 1997). Hamel (1992) states they 'do not hunt from exposed perches.'\r\nGreat crested flycatchers are cavity nesters (Lanyon 1997).  Nest in natural or old woodpecker hole, 20 to 50 feet above the ground (Kaufman 1996). Lanyon (1997) states that they 'usually prefer dead over live trees, and natural cavities over abandoned woodpecker holes.' Morrison (1988) suggested a preference for nestboxes that are hung from trees as opposed to stationary boxes; the former may be less likely to be used by starlings.\r\nRegarding spatial habitat characteristics, occurrence increases with tracts above 180 acres (AL).\r\nAdditional information:\r\nMcIntyre (1995) found that great crested flycatchers in the north Georgia Piedmont did not occur in forest patches less than 13.25 ha. Lohr et al. (2002) conducted a study of experimental removal of snagss from loblolly pine forests at the Savanah River site.  Enough great-crested flycatchers were detected in this habitat type to show a negative effect on abundance of great-crested flycatchers from  snag removal from loblolly pine forests. Great-crested flycatchers were common in clearcuts of all sizes within the Savanah River site loblolly plantations (Krementz and Christie 2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bGCFLx", "ELCode": "ABPAE43070", "scientific_name": "Myiarchus crinitus", "ITIS_TSN": "178309", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105609", "common_name": "Great Crested Flycatcher"}}
