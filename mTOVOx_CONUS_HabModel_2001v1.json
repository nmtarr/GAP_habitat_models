Of Washington and are inhabitants of wet meadows and marshes with dense grass and sedge cover, apparently avoiding forest and dense brush (Wilson and Ruff 1999). They are good swimmers capable of crossing small streams and often occupy shalllowly flooded areas during wet winters (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Diets consist of Juncus, horsetail, clover, and numerous grass species. In California, Townsend's vole is found in coastal Humboldt and Del Norte counties. It is abundant in valley foothill riparian, wet meadow, and pasture habitats, and it is common in fresh and saline emergent wetlands, grasslands,and early successional stages of many forest habitats ([Brylski et al. 2008 CA WHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In Oregon, M. townsendii is associated with moist meadows, lowland pastures, riparian zones, boggy lands, marshes, and irrigated grass and sedge fields. Occasionally, the will used alder streamsides adjacent to meadows and grassy habitats (Verts and Carraway 1998, Maser et al. 1981, Bailey 1936, Goertz 1964, Howell 1920, 1923).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mTOVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11040", "scientific_name": "Microtus townsendii", "ITIS_TSN": "180316", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105664", "common_name": "Townsend's Vole"}}
