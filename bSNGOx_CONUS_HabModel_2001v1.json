They are abundant migrants in extreme eastern Colorado and winter residents in southeast Colorado.  White morphs are abundant fall and spring migrants and winter residents in the Arkansas River valley but uncommon elsewhere. The blue morph is uncommon to common during spring and fall migration in the Arkansas River valley, rare elsewhere. They are very Rare winter resident on eastern plains.  They are more common east of the Rockies where they are generally associated with large marsh and wetland habitats. During migration between winter and summer habitat, many snow geese pass through Utah, congregating in such areas as Gunnison Bend in Millard Co.  They are found in the Rockies.\r\n\r\nSuitable winter habitat includes wetlands and standing water as well as grassy areas for foraging:  coastal freshwater and brackish marshes, fields of waste potatoes (Solanum tuberosum), inland freshwater marshes, impoundments, marine inlets, saltwater cordgrass, salt grass (Disticilis spicata) marsh, salt-meadow grass, upland coastal bluestem prairie, rice (Oryza sativa) fields, soybean fields (Glycine max), rye (Secale cereale), wheat,marine bays, wet prairies, extensive sandbars, wet grasslands, pastures, tidal marshes of deltas dominated by American bulrush and flooded agricultural fields (Hill & Frederick 1997, BNA #514).   They are attracted to freshly burned ground because once above ground vegetation is removed, tubers and roots are easy foraging.  N.
