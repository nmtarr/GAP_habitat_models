Individuals can be observed on land occupying savannas, croplands, chaparral, and hardwood woodlands (Natureserve.org). This toad is fairly common in cane fields, open forests, well-watered lawns and gardens, and around houses (Green et al. 2014). The cane toad is also found in man-made environments such as human settlements, suburban parks and gardens, but also in pristine montane and lowland forests while avoiding densely vegetated areas (IUCNRedlist.org; Krakauer 1968). It appears more rare in natural settings than heavily disturbed areas (Green et al. 2014). This species is more common in areas devoid of other species, but it is unclear if other species avoid areas where the cane toad is found (Green et al. 2014). These toads can generally be found in the drier pinelands and drier ground within the Everglades area (Green et al. 2014).\r\n\r\nUses grasses found in chaparral and herbaceous forests, but since they exhibit high heat tolerance they are often found in ponds with little vegetative cover (Krakauer 1970).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCANEx", "ELCode": "AAABB01100", "scientific_name": "Rhinella marinus", "ITIS_TSN": "776032", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103751", "common_name": "Cane Toad"}}
