For successful inhabitation, the species requires\r\nan expansive forested area that contains large mature and decadent trees that\r\nprovide cavities suitable for security and reproduction (Allen 1987). Requires areas that contain nesting cavities and roost trees, with fairly open areas nearby for foraging (Johnsgard 1988) including meadows and marshes (Eckert and Karalus 1987). While hunting, perches on isolated trees overlooking open areas; also hunts by flying through the woods (Eckert and Karalus 1987).  They are also common along lakeshores and especially in cypress swamps (Wolfe and de la Torre 1990). In the mountains, they may be found in uplands, hemlocks, coves, and along wooded streams (GA).  They are found throughout the mountains from the spruce-fir zone down to the southern hardwoods (Alsop 1991).  Barred owls do not occur on the barrier islands (Fussell and Lyons 1990).  Permanent resident of Florida.  In Florida they use mixed hardwood swamps, cypress swamps, and  live oak - cabbage palm hammocks (Layne et al. 1977).  Rare in fragmented woodlots (Fussell 1994), although may use them if the trees are sufficiently large (Eckert and Karalus 1987). Presence of large trees may be key factor in each habitat type (Wolfe and de la Torre 1990). Appears to prefer older stands but uses earlier stages of forest succession if enough large trees or snags (or nest boxes) are present.  Often in forests with relatively open understory. Prefers canopy closure of 60% or greater. They are often replaced by the great horned owl in fragmented open forests (Allen 1987).  Cover types in order of preference were: oak woodland, mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland, white cedar swamps, oak savanna, alder swamps, marshes, and old fields (Allen 1987).\r\nNest trees are generally large (at least 50 cm breast-height diameter) (Johnsgard 1988). Generally nests in cavities, but also abandoned nests of squirrels (Ehrlich et al. 1988), corvids and hawks, especially Red-shouldered Hawk, rarely hollow stumps (Wolfe and de la Torre 1990). Uses both living and dead trees. Trees with cavity suitable for nesting generally at least 51 cm DBH; habitat suitability index model assumes that a density of at least 2 stems of this diameter per 0.4 ha represents high quality habitat for reproduction; high quality reproductive habitat also indicated by canopy cover of overstory trees of 60% or more (Allen 1987).  However, a pair was found nesting on the ground at Seven-Mile Fire Tower, Everglades National Park. The nest was placed within the base of the tower behind a concrete block that forms the bottom step of the first flight of stairs.\r\nThere is not a lot of information on elevation limits, but studies of the birds of the Smoky Mountains National Park cite that they are common below 5,000 ft. or 1,500 m (Stupka 1963, Alsop 1991)\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nThe Barred Owl is a resident of deep forests, including swamps, riparian, and upland habitats. In the twentieth century, it has expanded its range north and west through the boreal forest, and south to northern California. Range expansion into the Pacific Northwest has brought the Barred Owl into contact with the closely related Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis). The more aggressive Barred Owl has been known to displace and hybridize with the Spotted Owl, a further threat to that already endangered species (quoted directly from Mazur and James 2000).\r\n\"Fifty-five percent of barred owl observations in the Pacific Northwest have been reported near a wetland cover type. The apparent relationship between barred owls and wetlands may stem from past forest management in the region. In the Pacific Northwest, low elevation forests historically have been those initially subjected to timber harvest and management. Low elevation areas in the this region contain a greater abundance and distribution of wetlands than do tracts of higher elevation and steeper topography. Older seral vegetation stages now occur in these areas, resulting in mixed coniferous and deciduous stands that provide suite barred owl habitat, frequently in relatively close proximity to wetlands. Analysis of four decades of barred owl detections (collected specimens, calls, and visual sightings) in the Pacific Northwest provide the following examples of where the species occurs in this region (Hamer, unpubl.). Eighty-three percent of observations (n=140) were at sites <1,067 m in elevation (range: sea level to 1,981 m).\" (Allen 1987).\r\nIn Montana, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)\u2013lodgepole pine (Pinus ponderosa)\u2013western larch (Larix occidentalis) forests (Shea 1974), and mixed-conifer forests in Idaho (Wright and Hayward 1998). Second-growth (80 yr old) mixed deciduous-conifer used in Washington (Leder and Walters 1980, Hamer 1988) (quoted directly from Mazur and James 2000).\r\n\r\nNortheast:\r\nThroughout its range, found in association with mature and old-growth forests, typically of mixed deciduous-coniferous composition. In New Jersey, found in old-growth hardwood, cedar swamps, and upland oak-pine forests (Sutton and Sutton 1985, Laidig and Dobkin 1995). In New Hampshire and Connecticut, mixed hardwood-conifers; avoids marshes and agricultural lands (Smith 1978). Old-growth hemlock, maple, and hemlock-maple forests used in Michigan (Elody and Sloan 1985) (quoted directly from Mazur and James 2000).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\n\"Definite preferences for specific cover types were exhibited by barred owls in Minnesota (Nicholls and Warner 1972). Cover types in order of preference were (1) oak (Quercus spp.) woodland, (2) mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland, (3) white cedar (Thuja occidental is) swamps, (4) oak savanna, (5) alder (Alnus spp.) swamps,-Wmarshes, and (7) old fields. Oak woodland and mixed deciduous/coniferous cover types contained trees that provided perch sites and cavities and cover for prey species. The first four cover types were normally free of dense understory vegetation, that might have facilitated foraging through increased visibility and reduced obstructions to flight. Nicholl s and Warner (1972) attributed the barred owl's preference for upland woodlands to drier conditions on the forest floor, as compared to wetter lowland sites, and the likelihood that prey were easier to hear and locate under dry conditions. Lower use of white cedar swamps by barred owls was attributed to an absence of suitable nest sites, lower prey availability, and less than ideal hunting conditions (e.g., muffled noise due to wet substrate and dense understory). The relatively open oak savanna cover type received lower use by barred owls. Although prey were believed to be abundant in this cover type, the trees present were smaller in height and diameter than those within the oak and mixed woodlands, resulting in a lack of suitable cavities and decadent trees. The barred owl\u2019s low use of alder swamps was attributed to extremely dense tree canopy cover that could inhibit the owl\u2019s mobility and foraging success. Suitable cavities and nest trees were absent in this cover type. Marshes and open fields did not contain suitable trees for perch sites or cover. Although prey were abundant in the old field cover type, they were not accessible. No seasonal differences in reference for these cover types, nor major differences in the intensity of cover type use between sexes, were recorded.\" (Allen 1987).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBADOx", "ELCode": "ABNSB12020", "scientific_name": "Strix varia", "ITIS_TSN": "177921", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103621", "common_name": "Barred Owl"}}
