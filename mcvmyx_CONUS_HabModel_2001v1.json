scrub-grassland, sacatan grassland, Chihuahuan desertscrub, Sonoran desertscrub, Plains and Great Basin swamp and riparian scrub, pine-oak woodlands, and oak savannah (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The species is a desert and grassland bat that mainly roosts in caves and is associated with watercourses (Findley et al. 1975).  The species is found among cottonwood, willow, sycamore, ponderosa pine, pinyon, juniper, western live oak, saltcedar, rabbitbrush, tarbush, ocotillo, palo verde, cacti, creosotebush, brittlebrush, netleaf and silverleaf oaks, gray oak, emory oak, Toumey's oak, grama and buffalograss, tobosa, Apache plume, and mesquite (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  M. velifer inhabits caves in the limestone region of southeastern New Mexico, and it has also roosted in barn swallow nests.  The species is the most dependent of all North American bats on abandoned or inactive mines (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It is never more than a few miles from a watersource, such as canals, tanks, or creeks (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Elevation is from 268-2,668 m (Cockrum 1960, Newmark 2003). In New Mexico, the species is active at temperatures of 18-26 degrees Celsius and has little ability to thermoregulate at lower temperatures (Fitch et al. 1981).  Hibernacula have been observed in Mexico, Arizona, New Mexico and Kansas (Newmark 2005).  M. velifer is a migratory species in general, though some may hibernate in southwestern New Mexico (Thompson et al. 1996).  Hibernacula in wet mines in Arizona should be between 8 and 11 degrees Celsius (Thompson et al. 1996).  During non-migratory seasons, populations may have home ranges of several hundred square kilometers (NatureServe 2004). The elevation is 92-2,684m (Arizona Game and Fish Department 2002).  It is present from southern Mojave County southeastward along the Mogollon Plateau in Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986).  The species occurs in southwestern New Mexico north to the Mogollon Plateau and San Mateo Mountains and in the southeast north to Alamagordo and through Lincoln County in the Pecos River drainage (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCVMYx", "ELCode": "AMACC01050", "scientific_name": "Myotis velifer", "ITIS_TSN": "180003", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106328", "common_name": "Cave Myotis"}}
