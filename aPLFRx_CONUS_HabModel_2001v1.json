In New Mexico, its distribution occurs along the Rio Hondo, Rio Bonito, and the upper reaches of Rio Pe\u00f1asco (2130m) in the vicinity of Sierra Blanca in Lincoln County. Also found along the Pecos River near Carlsbad in Eddy County and along the Rio Grande to include Ash Canyon by Truth or Consequences in Sierra County. Other reports include disjunct populations on the west side of the Chiricahua Mountains in Turkey Creek specifically and the neighboring Sulphur Springs Valley in Cochise County, Arizona. Hybridization with the northern leopard frog is reported along the Cimarron River in the vicinity of Springer, along Mora River downstream of Wolf Creek, and along the Rio Grande specifically north of Elephant Butte Reservoir. Hybridization with the Rio Grande leopard frog is reported to occur throughout the overlapping portion their range (Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). In Colorado, plains leopard frogs only occur below 1828 meters (Hammerson 1999). Furthermore, in Arizona, this species is found in cattle tanks, ditches, ponds, and streams found in Semidesert Grassland and Madrean Evergreen Woodland. Persist only in two of its historical localities in the state (Brennan and Holycross 2009; Brown et al. 1993; Degenhardt et al. 1996). Also in Arizona, this species occurs on the western side of the Chiricahua Mountains and the proximate Sulfer Springs Valley at an elevational range of 110 to 2590 meters (Stebbins 1985). In Missouri, this species is found everywhere but in the Ozark Plateau and in the extreme southeast region of the state (Brown 1992).\r\nPrimarily found in desert and prairie grasslands of central south Great Plains. Also known to utilize oak and oak-pine woodlands as well as farmland. This species can be found in prairie streams, ponds, and playas characterized as muddy and shallow (Stebbins 2003). Breeding takes place in temporary pools (Stebbins 2003), margins of ponds, marshes, and streams (Behler and King 1979). Also in ditches, streams, temporary pools, river sloughs, wetlands, marshes, and canyon pools (Stebbins 1985).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aPLFRx", "ELCode": "AAABH01040", "scientific_name": "Lithobates blairi", "ITIS_TSN": "775080", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104999", "common_name": "Plains Leopard Frog"}}
