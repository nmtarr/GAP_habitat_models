They can be found in boreal, coniferous, and deciduous forests, tundra, coastal islands and shorelines, prairies and grasslands, isolated settlements, towns, cities, deserts, and agricultural fields.  They prefer heavily contoured landscapes such as areas with cliffs, trees, or human structures necessary for nesting (Boarman and Heinrich, 1999).  Large numbers may gather at communal roosts in trees, cliff ledges, high-tension power-line towers, and telephone poles (Goodwin 1976, Boarman and Heinrich 1999).  Common Ravens are omnivorous and forage on the ground (Goodwin 1976, Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996, Potter et al. 1980).\r\n\r\nRavens nest on a variety of substrates including cliffs, highway overpasses and billboards, churches, power poles, oil derricks, railroad trestles, windmills, communication towers, sea cliffs, rock quarries, woodlots, and isolated coniferous trees (Harrison 1975, Potter et al. 1980, Hamel 1992, Boarman and Heinrich 1999).  In Washington, they may avoid areas along rivers when choosing nesting sites, and in Wyoming they prefer forest edges and isolated trees over forest interiors (Boarman and Heinrich 1999).  \r\n\r\nIn the arid southwest, Common Ravens occur in significantly greater numbers in landfills, agricultural fields, and along highways than in open deserts.  They can be found in areas of juniper (Juniperus monosperma), cholla (Opuntia imbricata) and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) in association with prairie dog towns (Clark et al. 1982).  They are fairly common residents throughout open parts of Arizona wherever nesting cliffs are available (Phillips et al., 1984), and local breeders in the northern part of the lower Colorado River Valley, but become increasingly rare farther south (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In Colorado, they mainly live in mountains and forests; breeding on cliffs and rocky outcroppings (Kingery 1998).  They are widespread over the entire state of Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  In New Mexico, they occur in most of the wooded foothills and forested mountains of the state that are over 1,524 m (Ligon 1961).\r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, Common Ravens are found at high elevations, usually above 3,000 ft, and they breed in mountainous areas where cliffs or rocky crags are present for nesting (Hamel 1992, Simpson 1992).  They frequently forage in open woods, margins, and fields at high elevations, as well as campgrounds, picnic areas, dumps, and other places with garbage (Hamel 1992).   N.
