Habitats include coastal salt water; chiefly nearshore open ocean, but also larger bays and estuaries. Appears to prefer more offshore waters than other loons (Moffitt 1938, Grinnell and Miller 1944, Howell and Webb 1995). A large (perhaps 10,000 individuals) wintering population occurs locally in Puget Sound/Strait of Georgia region of Washington and British Columbia at favored localities such as Semiahmoo Point, Deception Pass, Rosario Strait, and Active Pass (e.g., Vermeer 1977). In inland marine waters of Puget Sound area, prefers narrow straits and passes with strong currents (quoted directly from Russell 2002).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe Pacific Loon occurs in the southwest region as an inland migration vagrant occuring on large reservoirs, deep lakes, and along large rivers particularly the Columbia and Colorado Rivers (Russell 2002). Habitat affinities  include reservoirs and occasionally small lakes (Andrews and Righter 1992). Pacific Loons forage on fish, crustaceans, mollusks, aquatic insects, and have been known to feed on aquatic seeds and some aquatic plants (Natureserve).\r\nAlong central California coast, concentrates in large feeding flocks beyond the kelp line, with a few individuals scattered over deeper water to =>15 km offshore (Roberson 1985). In Monterey Bay, significantly more Pacific Loons found within 500 m of shore occurred over sandy bottom substrate than over rocky bottom. Off San Diego, commonest on ocean 2\u201316 km from shore and uncommon to rare inside bays and harbors (Unitt 1984)(quoted directly from Russell 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bPALOx", "ELCode": "ABNBA01050", "scientific_name": "Gavia pacifica", "ITIS_TSN": "174475", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100814", "common_name": "Pacific Loon"}}
