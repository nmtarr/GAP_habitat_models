Nests individually or semi-colonially in remote areas, preferring sites that command a clear view in all directions with permanent water not far away, including lakes, ponds, larger streams, marshes, muskegs, and wet hummocky areas (NatureServe 2010, Mowbray et al. 2002). Canada geese tend to use wooded or scrubby islands in marshes and rivers, but also muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) houses, floating mats of reeds and even elevated platforms and abandoned nests of birds of prey (Mowbray et al. 2002). In southern part of range, prefers marshes, especially those with hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus) or cattail (Typha spp.) with muskrat houses and feeding platforms, but also nests in meadows and on gravel bars and islands of inland lakes and the sea. Also breeds successfully in agricultural and urban areas in southern part of its breeding range; in agricultural fields, near irrigation ditches, reservoirs, sewage lagoons, city lakes and parks, golf courses, lawn-rich subdivisions, highway medians, and on tops of city buildings (Mowbray et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCANGx", "ELCode": "ABNJB05030", "scientific_name": "Branta canadensis", "ITIS_TSN": "174999", "Global_SEQ_ID": "770965", "common_name": "Canada Goose"}}
