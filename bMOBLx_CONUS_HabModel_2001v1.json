On a few occasions, they have been observed nesting in crack on the side of a cliff or in a rock outcrop (Rowley, 1939; Rich, 1984). Numerous nest boxes have been placed throughout the country, often along fencelines in agricultural areas (Munro and Rounds, 1985; Holt and Martin, 1997; Panjabi, 2004; Citta and Lindberg, 2007). The species has also been known to nest in other man-made structures, such as sheds and storage boxes (Weydemeyer, 1929; Riggs, 1956; McCluskey, 1979). Preferred nesting habitat consists of relatively open woodlands or savannas (McClelland et al., 1979; Holt and Martin, 1997; Panjabi, 2004; Johnson et al., 2006) or forest/grassland ecotones (McCluskey, 1979; Power, 1980; Scott et al., 1980; O\u2019Meara et al., 1981; Dobkin et al., 1995; Panjabi, 2004; Wiggins, 2006). Specific vegetation associations in which the species has been documented nesting include: aspen groves and parkland, sometimes with sagebrush, douglas-fir, or lodgepole pine (Salt, 1957; Kermott et al., 1974; Scott et al., 1980; DeByle, 1981; Dobkin et al., 1995; Hutto, 1995; Sullivan, 1995; Dieni and Anderson, 1999; Aitken and Martin, 2004; Martin et al., 2004; Wiggins, 2006); pinyon-juniper woodland (O\u2019Meara et al., 1981; Hutto, 1995; Wiggins, 2006); juniper woodland (Reinkensmeyer et al., 2007); oak-juniper woodland (Power and Lombardo, 1996); krummholz subalpine fir (Barash, 1976); ponderosa pine woodland (McCluskey, 1979; Scott et al., 1980; Hutto, 1995; Panjabi, 2004; Wiggins, 2006); spruce-fir forest (Hutto, 1995); montane mixed conifer (Franzreb and Ohmart, 1978; Hutto, 1995; Holt and Martin, 1997); and ash woodlands (Hopkins et al., 1986).\r\n\r\nBoth burned and logged forests tend to be well-suited to S. currucoides habitation, with abundance often higher in these sites than in surrounding forest (Franzreb and Ohmart, 1978; Bone and Klukas, 1990; Hutto, 1995; Sullivan, 1995; Dieni and Anderson, 1999; Hutto and Young, 1999; Panjabi, 2004; Schwab et al., 2006; Russell et al., 2007). However, the species is rare in burned grassland and shrubland (Reinkensmeyer et al., 2007). Closed canopy forests are avoided as are those with a dense understory (McCluskey, 1979; Power, 1980; Schwab and Sinclair, 1994; Holt and Martin, 1997; Hutto and Young, 1999; Panjabi, 2004; Schwab et al., 2006).\r\n\r\nNest heights average roughly 3 m above the ground (Kermott et al., 1974; Dobkin et al., 1995; Martin et al., 2004), though Scott et al. (1980) documented mean heights of 7 m.\r\n\r\nMountain bluebirds forage on the ground (Hutto, 1995) in open areas, such as: native grasslands (Aitken and Martin, 2004; Panjabi, 2004); sagebrush (Haecker, 1948; Rich, 1984); along fence rows and utility lines (Herlugson, 1982); grass-shrub transition (Schwab and Sinclair, 1994; Schwab et al., 2006); prairies, hayfields, and fallow fields, and other areas with short vegetation or bare ground (Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Power, 1980). However, foraging only occurs in close proximity to nest sites (Aitken and Martin, 2004; Haecker, 1948;  Herlugson, 1982). The species specifically avoids tall vegetation for foraging, with \u2018tall\u2019 being defined as greater than tarsal length (Powers, 1980), or roughly 23 mm (Power and Lombardo, 1996). Individuals have been known to fly up to 700 m from nest sites, past ample tall grass, in order to access preferred grassland (Power, 1980); O\u2019Meara et al. (1981) documented the species remaining within 100 m of nesting habitat; Rich (1984) observed individuals traveling ~200 from nesting to foraging sites. Otherwise, the species is rare in shrubland lacking suitable nesting trees (Dumas, 1950; Herlugson, 1978; Medin et al., 2000).\r\n\r\nDobkin et al. (1995) noted that nest sites were at a mean distance of 14.7 m from forest edge, while McCluskey (1979) documented a maximum distance of 14.9 m from openings.\r\n\r\nWhile Schwab (Schwab and Sinclair, 1994; Schwab et al., 2006) has documented mountain bluebirds in shrub-dominated habitats, others specifically note the species\u2019 avoidance of shrubs except where the presence of artificial nest boxes enables the species to inhabit open shrubland (Holt and Martin, 1997; see also: Munro and Rounds, 1985; Panjabi, 2004).\r\n\r\nThe mountain bluebird ranges in elevation from ~900 m in California (Haecker, 1948) and ~850 in British Columbia (Aitken and Martin, 2004) to more than 4250 m in Colorado (Haecker, 1948; see also: Rowley, 1939; Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Scott et al., 1980; Sullivan, 1995). In the four corners states, the species typically nests above 2500 m (Sullivan, 1995; Wiggins, 2006), though some have been documented as low as 1365 m (Wiggins, 2006).\r\n\r\nIn winter, the mountain bluebird inhabits lower elevations (Wiggins, 2006), in: grasslands (Power and Lombardo, 1996; Block and Morrison, 2010); savannas and woodlands with oak, juniper, and/or pinyon pine (Balda and Masters, 1980; Power and Lombardo, 1996; Wiggins, 2006; Burnett and Fair, 2008); agricultural areas (Power and Lombardo, 1996); and scattered trees around parks and yards (Balda and Masters, 1980). During the winter, they feed on juniper berries (Burnett and Fair, 2008), and their distribution is largely restricted to areas in which junipers are available (Power and Lombardo, 1996; Wiggins, 2006). During this time, they can be found at elevations up to ~2400 m in Colorado (Righter et al., 2004; see also: Burnett and Fair, 2008), with most examples in California limited to < 1500 m (Zeiner et al., 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bMOBLx", "ELCode": "ABPBJ15030", "scientific_name": "Sialia currucoides", "ITIS_TSN": "179811", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104039", "common_name": "Mountain Bluebird"}}
