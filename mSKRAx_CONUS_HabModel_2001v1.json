They have been found at elevations ranging from 55 to 1250 meters (USFWS 1997).\r\nThe USFWS describes habitat: \"Studies have variously characterized habitat occupied by this species as \u2018\u2018sparse vegetation, level or rolling topography, and soil that is neither extremely dense nor largely sand\u2019\u2019 (Lackey 1967, p. 318) or as consisting of annual grasslands with sparse cover of perennial shrubs (Price and Endo 1989, p. 294). The term \u2018\u2018grassland\u2019\u2019 is a generalization of this species\u2019 preferred vegetation community; the Stephens\u2019 kangaroo rat appears to have a higher affinity for vegetation communities dominated by herbaceous plants (forbs) with a low density of grasses than for a vegetation community dominated by grasses (O\u2019Farrell and Clark 1987, p. 10; O\u2019Farrell and Uptain 1987, p. 9).\r\nStephens\u2019 kangaroo rat prefers grassland communities dominated by forbs rather than by annual grasses, as annual forbs provide critical greens in the spring, furnish temporary cover, produce large seeds, and rapidly disintegrate after drying, resulting in substantial patches of bare ground (O\u2019Farrell and Uptain 1989, p. 7; O\u2019Farrell and Clark 1987, p. 10) that provide suitable conditions for the species\u2019 specialized mode of locomotion (Bartholomew and Caswell 1951).\r\nStephens\u2019 kangaroo rat reaches its highest densities in grassland communities dominated by forbs and characterized by moderate to high amounts of bare ground, moderate slopes, and well-drained soils (O\u2019Farrell and Uptain 1987, pp. 35, 36; O\u2019Farrell 1990, p. 80; Anderson and O\u2019Farrell 2000, p. 12). Stephens\u2019 kangaroo rat has been found on 36 types of well-drained soils, and more than 125 soil types (Service 1996, p. 6) that are capable of supporting annual grasses mixed with forbs and shrub species.\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSKRAx", "ELCode": "AMAFD03100", "scientific_name": "Dipodomys stephensi", "ITIS_TSN": "180247", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103382", "common_name": "Stephen's Kangaroo Rat"}}
