Sympatric with recently described D. folkertsi at the southern end of the range (Camp et al. 2002). It is found in or along the banks of rocky, swift-moving streams with cool, clear water, near waterfalls and seeps.  Refuges are in rock crevices or in burrows (Camp and Lee 1996).  Usually found at elevations greater than 500 meters, but sometimes is found at lower elevations when local conditions are suitable (Petranka 1998).  Eggs are laid on undersides of rocks or on tree roots in streambed, apparently in headwater tributaries in North Carolina (Bruce 1985).  Lays up to about 60 eggs in June-July, singly or in cluster. The female remains with eggs until hatching. In Virginia, aquatic larvae hatched in August-September, metamorphosed in 2 years; larval period was 3-4 years (sometimes 2 years) in North Carolina (Bruce 1985, Bruce 1988). In northeastern Georgia, hatching occurred in July, and the larval period lasted 3 or 4 years, depending on location (Austin and Camp 1992). In North Carolina, females require at least 7-8 years to reach sexual maturity, males at least 6 years (Bruce 1988; Castanet et al. 1996).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBESAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03080", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus quadramaculatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173642", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105247", "common_name": "Black-bellied Salamander"}}
