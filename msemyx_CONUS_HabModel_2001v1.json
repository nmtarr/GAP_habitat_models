They forage in mesic forest, Carolina Bay wetlands, and large bottomland swamps during summer. It is believed to rarely go into long-term torpor and is active throughout much of the year, especially in the southern portion of its range (Bat Conservation International 2014, Ammerman et al. 2012).  It has been documented foraging throughout winter above lakes, marshes, in riparian forest, shrubby old fields, and small slash pine-laurel oak woodlots.\r\n\r\nCave roosts are used year-round but many maternity roosts are located in hollow trees.  Adult males and nonbreeders tend to roost apart from maternity colonies in caves, buildings, culverts, and bridges (Hofmann et al. 1999). \r\n\r\nTheir range in Florida is associated with the distribution of caves, but several thousand individuals were found wintering in Tampa Bay mangroves in the 1920\u2019s and individuals have been found in buildings too (Marks & Marks 2006).  Several large maternity colonies have been discovered in Florida caves.  Maternity colonies are also known from one cave in Georgia and one in Alabama.  In the rest of the deep south, these bats use buildings and other structures, mines, and hollow trees for spring and summer roosts (Jones and Manning 1989).  In Texas, maternity roosts are located in large, hollow trees (Black gum, water tupelo, and sweet gum).\r\n\r\nIn the north, the pattern of cave use is different. Kentucky populations winter in caves, but are rare in most caves in the summer (MacGregor 1992).  However one large maternity colony in a Kentucky cave has been reported recently (MacGregor 1992).  The few old records from Indiana also were mostly from caves in winter.  Summer roost sites are poorly known from this part of their range.  At least one cave in Indiana had bats every month except May, June, and July (Mumford and Whitaker 1982).  Only two maternity colonies have been reported in this region, one in the Kentucky cave already mentioned, and another smaller colony in southern Illinois, where radio tagging led to the discovery of a maternity colony in a hollow tree in a hardwood swamp (Gore and Hovis 1992).
