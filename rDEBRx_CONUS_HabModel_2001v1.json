It occurs in Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Chiapas, from where this species ventures well into central Honduras (Christman 1982).\r\n\r\nThe habitat of preference is primarily characterized as herbaceous wetland. This species also occurs in forest wetland, riparian areas, scrub-shrub wetland, cropland, conifer forest, grassland, and various types of woodlands across its range. The Dekay\u2019s brownsnake burrows in soil or using soil, fallen logs, and leaf litter. It can be said that this species is found in nearly all terrestrial and wetland habitat types within its range and even into cities. The habitats in Mexico include cloud forest and tropical deciduous forest (Christman 1982; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Associated with rocks, crevices, fallen logs, and leaf litter as cover. This species occurs in a wide variety of wetlands with vast vegetation. In mexico, this species is found in tropical deciduous forests.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rDEBRx", "ELCode": "ARADB34010", "scientific_name": "Storeria dekayi", "ITIS_TSN": "174129", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100413", "common_name": "Dekay's Brownsnake"}}
