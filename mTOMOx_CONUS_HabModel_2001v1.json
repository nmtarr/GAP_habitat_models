In Tilamook county, OR, Giger (1973) recorded highest densities for the species in pasture areas provided earthworms were abundant (Verts and Carraway 1998). In the Olympic Mts. of WA, a population exists in alpine meadows at elevations ranging from 1500 to 1900 meters (Wilson and Ruff 1999). In California, \"Townsend's mole is found along the North Coast in Del Norte and Humboldt cos., from the Oregon border south through about two-thirds of Humboldt Co. Optimum habitats are annual grassland, wet meadow, and early seral stages of redwood, Douglas-fir, mixed conifer, and montane hardwood-conifer forests. Townsend's mole in California mainly is a species of lowland river bottoms.\" (quoted directly from CA WHR [Harris et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mTOMOx", "ELCode": "AMABB02010", "scientific_name": "Scapanus townsendii", "ITIS_TSN": "179983", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101956", "common_name": "Townsend's Mole"}}
