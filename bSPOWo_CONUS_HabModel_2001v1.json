(S. o. caurina), California Spotted Owl (S. o. occidentalis), and Mexican Spotted Owl (S. o. lucida).  Among the three subspecies, the following habitats are used: western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), mixed evergreen, mixed conifer, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas-fir/hardwood, evergreen hardwood, pine (Pinus)-oak (Quercus), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), riparian, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and other forest types, as well as steep, rocky canyons in different parts of its range (Gutierrez et al. 1995).\r\n\r\nGutierrez et al. 1995 reported an elevation limit of up to 1,200 m in the Northwest and 2,700 m in the Southwest (Gutierrez et al. 1995).\r\n\r\nNorthern Spotted Owls inhabit mature, mixed conifer forests with complex structure for nesting. (Gutierrez et al. 1995).  They roost in portions of forest where canopy closure is high and multiple subcanopy layers exist (Gutierrez et al. 1995).  Foraging habitat is similar to roosting habitat and occurs in managed and unmanaged forests (Gutierrez et al. 1995).  Winter habitat is the same as summer, but use of stands with a larger tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) and oak component was documented in the KIamath region. (Gutierrez et al. 1995).  In northern California, they prefer steep-sided canyons with north-facing slopes (Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nCalifornia Spotted Owls also inhabit forests with complex structure; from low elevation hardwood (oak) forests to high elevation conifer forests.  Like the Northern Spotted Owl, they use areas with lots of tree diameter classes represented and high canopy closure.  The presence of some trees > 90 cm dbh are a critical component of nesting habitat but owls forage in stands without these large trees (Gutierrez et al. 1995).  Some individuals of this subspecies migrate short distances to lower elevation Sierra Nevada hardwood riparian forests (Gutierrez et al. 1995).  They utilize smaller forest stands, with more shrubs and deciduous species (Gutierrez et al. 1995).  \r\n\r\nMexican Spotted Owls are found in forested slopes with rocky outcrops and heavily forested areas in areas of the Southwest (Ganey et al. 2011).  In the Southern Rockies, the most important forest type is mixed-conifer (e.g., Douglas-fir, white fir, ponderosa pine, limber pine, southwestern white pine), but pine-oak, ponderosa pine, and riparian communities are used for roosting and nesting as well.  Gambel oak is an important habitat component and trees with large dbh are utilized for roosting and nesting (Ganey et al. 2011).  Although canopy cover and tree dbh are important, high tree density does not appear to be important for this subspecies (Ganey et al. 2011).  They show a strong preference for old-growth forests and moderate to heavy canopy closure (>40%; Gutierrez et al. 1995 and Ganey et al. 2011).   Rocky canyonlands are suitable habitat for Mexican Spotted Owls in some areas provided they have steep narrow canyons with perennial water.  Such canyonlands usually but don\u2019t always contain patches of trees (conifer or riparian forests; Gutierrez et al. 1995).  In these areas, topography and geology are more influential on owl distribution than vegetation (Ganey et al. 2011).  In the Basin and Range ecoregion, Mexican Spotted Owls occur in evergreen oak woodlands, Madrean pine-oak forests, and Arizona cypress forests (Ganey et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nGutierrez et al. 1995 reported that owls in California require forest blocks of 40-240 ha (100-600 ac) (Gutierrez et al. 1995).
