Year-round resident of montane coniferous forests of western North America, primarily in areas dominated by pine, spruce, fir, and pinyon-juniper (McCallum et al. 1999).  Also in mixed coniferous-deciduous forests and riparian zones (McCallum et al. 1999).  Generally inhabit ponderosa pine forests in Arizona (Laudenslayer and Balda 1976).  Can be found in Colorado in pinyon-juniper woodlands, mainly pinyon pine and Utah juniper, with shrub species of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis), true mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus) and mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus) (O'Meara et al. 1981). In the centennial mountains of Idaho, this species can be found in the summer at elevations ranging from 1860-1940 m, with major vegetation including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willows (Douglas et al. 1992).  In Utah can be found in areas of mixed conifers and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) at elevations of 2200 m (Cooper 2000).  Found in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)  communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998).  Found as a resident in Colfax County, New Mexico in grazed and ungrazed rangeland consisting of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) (Goguen and Mathews 1998).  Found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona (Franzreb and Ohmart 1978).  This species can be found nesting in Montana in paper birch (Betula papyrifera) in cavities excavated by red-naped sapsuckers (McClelland and McClelland 2000).  In Colorado, this species mainly lives in mountain conifer forests (Kingery 1998).  Highest densities in Colorado were old growth spruce/fir, lodgepole pine, and ponderosa pine forests; although this species occurred extensively in pinyon-juniper, it did not breed there often (Kingery 1998).  In Arizona, this species is a common resident in pine and spruce-fir forests; this is one of the most conspicuous birds in the winter forests of northern Arizona (Phillips et al. 1964).  A casual fall and winter visitor in the lower Colorado River Valley, this species has been documented in cottonwood-willow riparian woodland (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  This species is resident in most of the mountain ranges statewide.  This species is one of the most widespread of the chickadees inhabiting New Mexico (Ligon 1961).  In New Mexico in summer it ranges from 2,287 m to near timberline; nests from 2,134 to 3,659 m (Ligon 1961). Occurs in winter as low as 1,524 m at Shiprock (Ligon 1961). In Colorado, breeds between 1,982-3,659 m (Kingery 1998). Has been recorded between 1,677-2,927 m in Nevada (Alcorn 1988).\r\nIn n. Arizona, Mountain Chickadee used pi\u00f1on pines disproportionately (Laudenslayer and Balda 1976); in ne. California, preferred white fir (Abies concolor) as foraging substrate in forest composed of white fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, and western juniper (J. occidentalis; Grundel 1984). In w. Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest, spent majority of time foraging in white fir, but foraging varied by season and spent more time on California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) during fall (Sep\u2013Oct), on incense cedar during winter (Nov\u2013Feb), and on sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) in late summer (Jul\u2013Aug; L. A. Brennan, M. L. Morrison, and DLD unpubl.)(quoted directly from Mccallum et al. 1999).\r\nIn California, this species frequents coniferous forests, especially ponderosa, Jeffrey, lodgepole, and eastside pine, as well as red fir and mixed conifer habitats (quoted directly from Green et al. taken from Zeiner et al. 1990).  \r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nMainly year-round resident of montane coniferous forests of w. North America, primarily in areas dominated by pine, spruce-fir (Picea-Abies), and pi\u00f1on-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus; Dixon 1961, Am. Ornithol. Union 1983). Occurs in mixed coniferous-deciduous forests and riparian zones, where it uses conifers more than expected by chance (e.g., Airola and Bennett 1985, Douglas et al. 1992, L. A. Brennan, M. L. Morrison, and DLD unpubl.)(quoted directly from Mccallum et al. 1999). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter:\r\nSimilar to breeding habitat, since some individuals remain on breeding territories and others relocate within breeding habitat. Also includes nonbreeding habitat, mostly broadleaf vegetation (e.g., cottonwoods) in human plantings (Martin and Martin 1996) and riparian areas below breeding elevations (quoted directly from Mccallum et al. 1999).\r\nIn California during winter, this mountain chickadees may move downslope to riparian and hardwood habitats. In the south, regularly moves downslope to foothills, irregularly to coast and desert regions. In the north, downslope movement occasionally extends to the humid outer coastal ranges (Grinnell and Miller 1944, McCaskie et al. 1979, Garrett and Dunn 1981)(quoted directly from Green et al. taken from Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bMOCHx", "ELCode": "ABPAW01040", "scientific_name": "Poecile gambeli", "ITIS_TSN": "554385", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101252", "common_name": "Mountain Chickadee"}}
