Well established populations are also found in shrubby coastal dunes, timberline, shrubby basins, canyons, and open mountain forests (Brown et al. 1995; Campbell and Lamar 2004; Hammerson 1999; Lowe et al. 1986; Nussbaum et al. 1983; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nNW\t - Forest/woodland, forest edge, conifer woodland, hardwood woodland, open mountain forests.\r\nSW\t - Shrubby coastal dunes, shrubby basins, canyons, grassland and herbaceous woodlands, savanna, shrubland and chaparral.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWERAx", "ELCode": "ARADE02140", "scientific_name": "Crotalus oreganus", "ITIS_TSN": "209548", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104250", "common_name": "Western Rattlesnake"}}
