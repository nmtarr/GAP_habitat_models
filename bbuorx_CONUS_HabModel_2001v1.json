In Arizona, usually in cottonwood, but also in mesquite; also salt cedar (Tamarix) that is at least 5 m tall (Rising and Williams 1999). In northeastern Colorado, this species is known to nest in cottonwood trees (Schaefer 1976). In Colorado is a common summer resident in western valleys and in eastern plains (Andrews and Righter 1992). Found in lowland riparian forests and urban areas with tall trees; will forage in willow and tamarisk shrublands.  Throughout much of the western United States, this species is the only breeding oriole. In west Texas, is often found in areas of mature mesquite (Prosopis) (Rising and Williams 1999). In summer in New Mexico, can be found from the lowest elevations to 7000 ft (2133 m) (Ligon 1961). Most common in New Mexico in the Rio Grande and Pecos Valleys, and prefer cottonwoods for nesting (Ligon 1961). Is sometimes treated as conspecific with the Northern Oriole (Icterus galbula) (Rising and Williams 1999). Also will nest in rural and urban human habitats (Ligon 1961).  Breeds along the Colorado River in Arizona in the summer (Swarth 1914). Can be found in southern Nevada in areas of mesquite dunes (Prosopis pubescens) and bosques (Prosopis juliflora) (Austin 1970). Occurs at elevations of 0-3,000m (Rising and Williams 1999).\r\nA fairly common to common, summer resident throughout most of California. Breeds \r\nprimarily in valley foothill riparian, valley foothill hardwood, and valley foothill hardwood-conifer \r\nhabitats, and corresponding montane habitats, especially in open stands of large trees. \r\nFrequents riparian deciduous trees and deciduous oaks. Breeding in coniferous forests \r\nlimited to stands with substantial numbers of hardwoods. Breeds most commonly in interior \r\nnorthern California and coastal southern California; common locally in southern deserts, and \r\nabsent from higher mountains. Rare to uncommon in winter in southern coastal areas, \r\nprimarily in introduced flowering trees and shrubs, especially eucalyptus (Grinnell and Miller \r\n1944, McCaskie et al. 1979, Garrett and Dunn 1981).(quoted directly from Zeiner et al. 1990 via Granholm et al. CA WHR).\r\nIn California this species prefers \u201criparian and oak [Quercus] woodlands, especially where trees are large and well spaced or in isolated clumps. Sycamores [Platanus], cottonwoods [Populus], willows [Salix], and deciduous oaks seem to be especially favored for nesting, but live oaks [Q. agrifolia], orchard trees, and occasionally conifers are used\u201d (Grinnell and Miller 1944). Usually near water (quoted directly from Rising and Williams 1999).\r\nNorthwest/Great Plains:\r\nIn Oregon, this species prefers riparian cottonwoods and semiopen oak and madrone (Arbutus) woodlands, or woodlots (Gilligan et al. 1994). In Arizona (Phillips et al. 1964), Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and e. New Mexico, usually in riparian cottonwoods, intermixed with willows (JDR). In s. Arizona, most common in mature cottonwood, but also in mature mesquite; also salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima) that is at least 5 m tall (Rosenberg et al. 1981). Prefers larger trees than Orchard Oriole (Icterus spurius) does (Scharf and Kren 1996). In Texas (Oberholser 1974), in areas where mature mesquite (Prosopis) predominates. Commonly nests in large mesquite trees, willows, and cottonwoods; also in pecan (Carya) trees. Lives in areas where woody vegetation is well spaced, often with grass and wildflower patches between; in w. Texas, often in widely separated trees (quoted directly from Rising and Williams 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBUORx", "ELCode": "ABPBXB9220", "scientific_name": "Icterus bullockii", "ITIS_TSN": "554267", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102107", "common_name": "Bullock's Oriole"}}
