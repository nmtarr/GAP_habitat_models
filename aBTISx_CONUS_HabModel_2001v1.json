While foraging and migrating between breeding habitats, the species can be found up 406 m from the nearest pond, although the average distance was 182 m (Semlitsch et al., 2007). Another study documents a median distance of 71 m from water (Madison and Farrand, 1998). Semlitsch (1998) argued that a 164 m buffer would include 95% of ambystomatids.\r\nIn the western U.S. tiger salamanders opt for open grass and shrublands, and are seldom found in closed forests or even woodlands (Spear et al., 2005; Washington Wildlife Habitat Connectivity Working Group, 2012). This pattern of habitat preference is seen in other ambystomatid species as well.\r\nIntroduced in several locations across California, A. mavortium has been known to hybridize with the California tiger salamander (A. californiense). In California, most populations occur at elevations of less than 305 m (1000 ft), but have been recorded up to 1370 m (4500 ft). Adults are mostly subterranean and utilize existing burrows such as those created by ground squirrels and occasionally man-made structures. Migrations from burrows occurs during the breeding season when individuals can be found beneath rocks, logs, other debris. Egg deposition and subsequent larval activity occurs in turbid, shallow pools (streams are rarely used) and among clumps of vegetation at water's edge ([CWHR 2008] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\nThroughout its range, the species relies on the presence of loose or sandy soils for burrowing.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBTISx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01142", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma mavortium", "ITIS_TSN": "668193", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100277", "common_name": "Barred Tiger Salamander"}}
