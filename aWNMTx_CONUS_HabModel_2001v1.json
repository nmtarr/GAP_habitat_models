In Arizona, it is found near Patagonia in Santa Cruz County, also south of San Xavier Mission and near Robles in Pima County, west to Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and Rio Sonoyta in Sonora, Mexico. In this area, its range extends as far north as Pena Blanca Springs and Sycamore Canyon in the Pajarito Mountains. In its eastern distribution, this species is found from southeast Nebraska to south Coahuila and from east Texas to Chihuahua (Stebbins 2003). Also, found in Missouri, then extending south to San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas (Conant and Collins 1998). \r\nHighly secretive toad found in wet burrows, under rocks, decaying vegetation, logs, crevices, and boards by streams, roadside ditches, springs, and rain pools. As ant eater this species can be found hidden under boards and logs by termite and nests (Lannoo 2005; Stebbins 2003). Found in grasslands, rocky and open wooded slopes, and marshy sloughs characteristics of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts. Shelter is provided by rocks, fallen debris, boards, damp places following rains, reptile, tarantula, and rodent burrows, and in the cracks of drying mud. Favorite food are ants (Conant and Collins 1998). Habitat is also described as grasslands and montane woodlands ranging from sea level to 1200 meters (Behler and King 1979).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aWNMTx", "ELCode": "AAABE01020", "scientific_name": "Gastrophryne olivacea", "ITIS_TSN": "173468", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102436", "common_name": "Western Narrow-mouthed Toad"}}
