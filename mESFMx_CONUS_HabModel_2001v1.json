It does not make long distance migrations.\r\n\r\nHabitat is mostly hilly or mountainous areas, in or near deciduous or evergreen forest, sometimes in open farmland (NatureServe 2005). \r\n\r\nSummer roost sites have been found in crevices of rock outcrops and boulders, shallow caves, holes and crevices in earthen banks, hollow trees, undersides of loose bark, and barns (Lee et al. 1982; Webster et al. 1985; Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Unpublished data from the Kentucky Heritage Program indicate that summer roosts include caves, coal mines, buildings, and bridges over rivers (in expansion joints).  In the southern Appalachians, roosts have also been found in hemlock forest (Webster et al. 1985).  Tuttle (1964) reported two individuals found in April in Tennessee under a large flat rock at the edge of a quarry surrounded by woods and cow pastures\u201d (NatureServe 2013). \r\n\r\nThe only known winter roosts are in caves and mines (Best and Jennings 1997).\r\n\r\nThey forage over small ponds & streams; along cliffs and ledges; and in wooded areas (Choate et al. 1994, NatureServe 2005).  \u2013 Regional habitat notes edited by N.
