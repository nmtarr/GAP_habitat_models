It occurs in mountain scrub, chaparral, moist meadows, grassy valleys, grassy clearings in forests, halophytic or semi-desert shrublands, marshes, rocky slopes near or in coniferous forests, alpine tundra, and also in recently cut or burned forest (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, NatureServe 2001, Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  It occurs in sagebrush in western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is a montane species, usually associated with meadows and forest-edge, and sometimes living in the forest itself (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It occurs in riparian spruce, willow, and alder communities, and riparian meadows in the spruce-fir zone (Findley et al. 1975).  M. longicaudus occupies drier situations when living with or near M. montanus (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  In the Kaibab Forest north of the Colorado River, some were found in swamps next to lakes and near springs, while near the tip of Point Imperial others were caught in sagebrush and chaparral-like conditions (Frey (2005) indicates these habitat associations are true in Nevada, but questions their validity in Arizona) (Hoffmeister 1986).  It is found in aspen, cottonwood-willow, willow-sedge, rushes, grama and buffalograss, Kentucky bluegrass, yarrow, vetch, bedstraw, wax currant, cheat grass, shrubby cinquefoil, bristlecone pine, limber pine, Apache pine, Chihuahuan pine, pinyon-juniper, red fir, hemlock, yellow pine, willow and alder riparian thickets, sage, mountain mahogany, and Symphoricarpus (Smolen and Keller 1987, Zeveloff 1988, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Hall 1995, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2003).  It is most common in mixed coniferous and spruce-fir forest, descending into ponderosa forest along sheltered canyon sides where stands of Abies, Pseudotsuga, and Picea occur (Findley et al. 1975, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  \r\nDuring winter bark, buds, and twigs of trees and shrubs (including oak, spruce, aspen, and snowberry) are eaten (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Fescues, sedges, yarrow, and Oregon-grape are also used (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  The fungus Endogone was in the diet of voles west of Boulder, Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  It has been caught as far as 0.81 km from water in Nevada, but needs water in New Mexico (Smolen and Keller 1987). Elevation is 1,290-3,659 (Zeveloff 1988, Tomlinson 2005). In Arizona, the species occurs on the Kaibab Plateau, Chuska Mountains, Lukachukai Mountains, San Francisco Mountains, Pinaleno Mountains, and the Mogollon Plateau (Hoffmeister 1986). It occurs in western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs in the northern two-thirds of Nevada (Hall 1995). It is found in the higher mountains of New Mexico except the Magdalena, Pinos Altos, and San Mateo mountains (Frey 2004). A report from the Zuni Mountains may actually refer to M. montanus (Frey 2004). M. longicaudus is found throughout Utah (Durrant 1952). Can be found in the following mountain ranges: Pinaleno Mountains; White Mountains; Lukachukai Mountains; Tunitcha Mountains; Mogollon Mountains; Magdalena Mountains; Manzano Mountains; San Mateo Mountains; Sangre de Christo Mountains; Jemez Mountains; Chuska Mountains; Ruby Mountains; Jarbidge Mountains; Shoshone Mountains; Roberts Mountains; Snake Mountains; Pine Forest Range; Toiyabe Range; Fox Range; Humboldt Range; Toquima Range; Monitor Range; Hot Creek Range; Quinn Canyon Range; Kawich Range; Carson Range; Henry Mountains; Black Hills; Mimbres Mountains; Sacramento Mountains; Pinaleno Mountains.\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn California, the long-tailed vole is found in the coastal zone from Mendocino Co. north to\r\nthe Oregon border; inland it occurs in the Sierra Nevada, Cascades, White and Warner Mts.,\r\nfrom the Oregon border south to Kern Co., and in the San Bernardino Mts. Common resident\r\nof herbaceous understories of many forest habitats. Abundant in montane riparian, as well as\r\nfresh emergent wetland, aspen, grassland, and wet meadow habitats. Occasionally\r\nfound in montane chaparral, sagebrush, and bitterbrush habitats (quoted directly from [Brylski et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In eastern Oregon, Feldhamer (1979) found this species exclusively in marshes of hardstem bulrush, common cattail, Baltic rush, and Carex spp. sedges. In western Oregon, Black and Hooven (1974) found this species on 1-10 year old clearcuts burned by wildfire within 2 years, but absent 5 years post fire. In eastern Washington, Rickard (1960) suggested a close association of M. longicaudus with dwarf shrubs of snowberry, Rosa, and Prunus spp. where < 20% of light reached the ground. Borell and Ellis (1934) reported in Nevada that sagebrush, riparian grass and brush, chapparal and grassy meadows, Salix thickets, and rock slides as habitats where this species could be encountered. Brown (1967) found M. longicaudus utilizing willow-aspen, quaking aspen forest with bluegrass and wheatgrass understory, and subalpine meadows of Wyoming. Also in Wyoming, Clark (1973) noted that this species uses wetter and more structurally complex habitats (such as shrub-sedge-grass-savannas and forb dominated aspen forest) than other vole species of the region.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLTVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11060", "scientific_name": "Microtus longicaudus", "ITIS_TSN": "180299", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102513", "common_name": "Long-Tailed Vole"}}
