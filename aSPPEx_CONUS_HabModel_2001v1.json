Isolated populations in extreme north east Kansas. Also, introduced in Cuba (Conant and Collins 1998; Lannoo 2005). They are found throughout the east in wooded habitats, but do not occupy the southern half of the Florida Peninsula (Conant and Collins 1998).\r\n\r\nSecretive species that is mostly only seen during breeding in woodlands characterized by brushy growth or cutover woodlots nearby temporary or permanent ponds or swamps (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding occurs in small wooded ponds, Carolina Bays, vernal pools, large swamps, cypress heads, flooded ditches, pine barrens, wet meadows, and sandy coastal habitats. Present in ponds that do not contain fish because they are too shallow or temporary, but persistent enough to support sourrounding emergent vegetation (Minton 2001 in Lannoo 2005). When not breeding, adults are found at the heads of streams, mesophytic and low hammock, open-bay heads, swamp borders, lowland marshes, sphagnum bogs and cattail wetlands, pools, ditches, and ponds near wooded areas (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSPPEx", "ELCode": "AAABC05090", "scientific_name": "Pseudacris crucifer", "ITIS_TSN": "207303", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105099", "common_name": "Spring Peeper"}}
