This species is a generalist and will nest in many habitat types.  It frequents open forests, woodlands and gardens; breeding primarily where lawns and other short-grass areas are interspersed with shrubs and trees, such as residential areas, towns, farmyards and parks (Sallabanks and James, 1999).  It is associated with forest edges (Sallabanks and James 1999).  Breeding habitats provide water and level ground in widely-spaced trees or in open flood-plains and meadows.  Most suitable habitat is urban areas; lawns with shade trees around towns (Sallabanks and James 1999).  Two important habitat requirements for the species are nest trees and mud to construct nests (Kaufman 1996).  Nests are constructed in the crotch or the fork of a horizontal branch of a shrub, sapling, or tree but are occasionally built on ledges of buildings (Nicholson 1997).\r\n\r\nNear Boulder, Colorado, in breeding season they are found in douglas-fir-ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine communities (Sallabanks and James 1999).  They can be found in southeastern Arizona in the Chiricahua Mountains in oak-juniper woodland, with major species Juniperus deppeana, Pinus leiophylla, Quercus emoryi, Quercus arizonica, and Pinus cembroides.   In the Chiracahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona, can be found in ponderosa pine woodlands, with major species of Pinus ponderosa, Pinus strobiformis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Quercus hypoleucoides, and Juniperus deppeana (Marshall 1957).  In the centennial mountains of Idaho, this species can be found in the summer at elevations up to 2300 m, with major vegetation including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), dry ponderosa pine, and willows (Douglas et al. 1992).  They are found in Gunnison County, Colorado in post-breeding season in areas of vegetation such as Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Wagner 1984).  In northern Arizona, they breed in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998).  They can be found nesting in Colorado at elevations around 1860 m, in a riparian area of boxelder-narrowleaf cottonwood-red osier dogwood (Acer negundo-Populus angustifolia-Cornus sericea) (Davidson and Knight 2001).  This species can be found breeding in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona in oak-juniper woodland communities consisting of Juniperus deppeana, Pinus leiophylla, Quercus emoryi, Quercus arizonica, and Pinus cembroides (Blada 1970).  They are found in riparian areas in Colorado near the Platte river, with major vegetation being Plains cottonwood, peachleaf willow (Salix amygdaloides), and boxelder (Acer negundo) (Sedgwick and Knopf 1987) and in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona.  In southwestern Washington, Robins prefer thinned forests over clear-cut and old growth stands.  In northeastern Oregon, they prefer forests in early- and late- seral stages (Sallabanks and James 1999).  In central Nevada this species can be found in the summer in stands of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) interspersed with willows (Salix spp.) and water birch (Betula occidentalis) with grassy meadows with various grasslike species.  This species can also be found in central Nevada on canyon slopes adjacent to these riparian areas.  These areas consist primarily of single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) and curl-leaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius) with sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) understory (Warkentin et al. 2003).\r\n\r\nAmerican Robins are found across the southeast but are absent from the barrier islands.  They are habitat generalists, robins are found in a variety of habitats such as forests, farmlands, cities, and towns.  In the Southeast, they occur in high elevation spruce-fir forests near open habitats and commonly near developed areas (Sallabanks and James 1999).  N.
