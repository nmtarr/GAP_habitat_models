Such habitats include hedgerows, orchards, marshes, riparian woodlands, overgrown and cultivated fields, shrubby edges, open second growth forests, open woodland, forest edges, shrubbery, farmlands, gardens and river flood plains (AOU 1983, Ehrlich et al. 1988, Simpson 1992, Nicholson 1997, McGraw and Middleton 2009).  \r\n\r\nAmerican Goldfinches will build nests in a wide variety of plants including, conifers and herbaceous plants, but short shrubs, deciduous saplings, and mature trees on forest edges or within open areas are most commonly used (McGraw and Middleton 2009).  They avoid mature forests and prefer sites in deciduous shrubs with upright, terminal clusters of twigs, beneath the canopy, the fork of a sapling, or the outer canopy of a tree at the forest margin (Nicholson 1997, McGraw and Middleton 2009).  Nest height varies with habitat and ranges from a few centimeters to several meters (Ehrlich et al. 1988, McGraw and Middleton 2009). \r\n\r\nAmerican Goldfinches can be found in riparian areas in southeastern Arizona, including areas dominated by velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), big-tooth maple (Acer grandintatum), Arizona sycamore (Plantanus wrightii), Arizona walnut (Juglans major) and willow (Salix spp.) (Strong and Bock 1990).  In Colorado, they occur mostly in open riparian habitats (including forests) and in adjacent fields as well as in agricultural areas, irrigated farms, pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, aspen, and urban areas (Kingery 1998, Andrews and Righter 1992).  In Utah, they are common permanent residents in lower canyons, valleys, cities and towns, and they prefer deciduous trees and shrubs for nesting (Behle et al., 1985).  \r\n\r\nNorthern populations of goldfinches migrate to more southerly locations once food sources fail or become inaccessible because of snow and ice (McGraw and Middleton 2009).   In the South, wintering goldfinches are associated with open, weedy habitats, but the plant communities that they use during winter have different species composition than those used during summer (McGraw and Middleton 2009).  Midwestern row-crop fields and natural grasslands are both used by wintering goldfinches but they prefer natural grasslands. (McGraw and Middleton 2009).  In Utah during the winter, they feed on seeds in open terrain, especially sunflower seeds (Behle et al., 1985).  They are common winter residents in Arizona in deciduous trees and weedy fields (Monson and Phillips, 1981).  N.
