Widely distributed from southwestern Canada to southern New Jersey, south into Mexico and Guatemala, and the southern part of Baja California. In New Mexico, it can be found across the state from 900m to 2800m in association with open ponderosa pine forest, pinon/juniper woodland, grasslands, shrublands, sandhills, marshes, and cultivated fields (Degenhardt et al. 1996). In other words, range extends from southern British Columbia, southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, Minnesota, and Indiana through almost all of western and central North America to northern Baja California (Grismer 2001). \r\n\r\nIn addition to its vast range, gopher snakes can also be found on Channel and Catalina Islands off coast of California; Coronado, San Martin, Cedros, Magdalena, and Santa Margarita Islands off the coast of Baja California; San Jose and Tiburon Islands in the Gulf of California (Stebbins 2003). In the Northwest, it is an exclusive snake of moist, dense forest mountainous ranges and coastal areas. Found in the Klamath Mountains of northern California and southwestern Oregon. Also in Oregon, found in the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon (St. John 2002). In more detail, gophersnakes can be found across the valleys of western Oregon, between the coast range and the Cascade Mountains. Also found in the Bishop and Whitman counties in Washington (Storm and Leonard 1995).\r\n\r\nNW\t-Herbaceous wetland, farmland, riparian zones, marshes, open coniferous forest, scrub-shrub wetland, and suburban residential areas.
