They forage under low light conditions in areas where flying insects are most abundant. Water and open areas such as grasslands, croplands, old fields, pine flatwoods, and sand pine scrub are typical foraging habitats (Layne et al. 1977, Poulin et al. 1996). They are also frequently observed foraging on insects attracted to lights in urban areas (Cleere 1998).   During the day, birds roost on the ground, in a tree limb, or on a roof (Nicholson 1997).  A study that measured distances from roosting to foraging grounds found an average of 2.7 km (SE = 0.1, n = 284 trips; Poulin et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nNesting takes place in areas with sand and bare ground, such as dunes, open scrubby woods, margins of thickets, rocky areas, sparsely vegetated or burnt areas in woodlands, coral flats, fields, vineyards, gardens, clear-cuts, and urban areas (Layne et al. 1977, Fussell 1994, Cleere 1998).  Common Nighthawks do not build nests, rather they place their eggs on flat substrate such as gravel roofs, gravel roads, sand, bare ground, cliffs, leaf litter, pine needles, loose stones, fence posts, crumbled bricks, burnt ground, sand, rock, or vegetation such as moss or lichens, sand dunes, between the rows of crops, and even between rails on active railway tracks (Cleere 1998, Potter et al. 1980).\r\n\r\nIn the southeastern U.S., Common Nighthawks prefer areas with sandy soil.  They are occasionally encountered around sand dunes and on barrier islands (Fussell and Lyons 1990).  They are found mostly in lowlands and valleys of mountainous areas (Simpson 1992).  In Louisiana, nests have been found on bare sand and among small tufts of grass (Poulin et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico, Colorado and Utah they are sometimes associated with prairie-dog towns in habitats of juniper (Juniperus monosperma), cholla (Opuntia imbricata), and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.; Clark et al. 1982).  In Nevada, they are most numerous in the high valleys and flats in the northern portion of the state (Alcorn 1988).  They can be found in the Rio Chama Wildlife and Fishing Area in central New Mexico in areas that historically contained ponderosa pine but are currently occupied by pinyon (Pinus edulis), juniper (Juniperus monosperma, J. utahensis) and oak (Quercus gambelli; Stahlecker et al. 1998).  They nest in open areas on the ground in Texas.\r\nIn Idaho, they occur in low foothills or ends of lower ridges not far from trees, and in the north-central U.S., they nest in open native grasslands (Poulin et al. 1996).  They are found in extensively logged and burned areas in British Columbia.\r\n\r\nElevation limits reported are 1,250 m in British Columbia and 3,048 m in Colorado (SWreGAP 2005, Poulin 1996).  N.
