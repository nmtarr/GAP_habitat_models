North American population may have been about 30-60 million (Natureserve). Reduced to about 1650 by 1903 (Natureserve). Population in 1983 was estimated at 75,000 (Natureserve). In Yellowstone NP, the herd was estimated at 3,000-3,500 in 1996 however over 1,000 were killed during the winter of 1996-97 by agency personnel (Natureserve). Prehistoric distribution was primarily on central grasslands and northern parklands of North America, but also used semideserts to boreal forests; where suitable grazing was available (Meagher 1986). Habitat includes the open plains and grasslands in south; woodland and openings in boreal forest, meadows, and river valleys in north (Natureserve).  Historically, bison roamed over much of Colorado, generally on the plains but also in the grasslands of the mountain parks and valleys, semidesert shrublands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and even ranged onto the alpine tundra (Fitzgerald et al., 1994). In historic times, bison were common and abundant on the eastern plains of New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975). Essentially gone from New Mexico by 1860, the last recorded bison kill was in 1884 (Findley et al. 1975). In 1836 Utah in the Salt Lake Valley there were large number of bison but by 1847 they were practically extinct (Durrant 1952). Bison are herbivores; feeds on grasses, forbs, and sedges (Natureserve). Bison are grazers; in northeastern Colorado shortgrass prairie and at Colorado National Monument, dominate forage is grass (Feldhamer et al. 2003). In shrub-steppe community in southern Utah, bison diet consisted on 93% grasses and sedges (Feldhamer et al. 2003). In northeastern CO, sedges were important only in spring (Feldhamer et al. 2003). In southwestern Colorado, forbs were common food items all year (Feldhamer et al. 2003). Like other large grazers, attracted to burned areas the next growing season (Natureserve). Altitude does not appear to have limited bison distribution in Colorado - there is evidence of bison at 3,903m (Meagher 1986). CWSD has an elevational range of 914-3,960m.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nTwo herds are located in the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) in KY and TN. The original herd of 19 animals from Theodore Roosevelt National Park were reintroduced in 1969 to the South Bison Range - 180 acres of pasture/open grasslands. In 1996, the LBL created a second herd area known as the Elk and Bison Prairie. It consists of 700 acres of woodland/shrublands and grassy pasture-like extension of a small patch of native prairie discovered after controlled burns conducted in the area in 1975.\r\n\r\nGreat Plains/Upper Midwest:\r\nDuring the growing season at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas, preferred areas that had been burned in spring; summer grazing was concentrated in large watershed area (79-119 ha) dominated by warm-season, perennial grasses; in fall and winter, grazed both burned and unburned watersheds more uniformly but grazed most intensively in areas with large stands of cool-season, grasses (Vinton et al. 1993).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBISOx", "ELCode": "AMALE01010", "scientific_name": "Bison bison", "ITIS_TSN": "180706", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101908", "common_name": "American Bison"}}
