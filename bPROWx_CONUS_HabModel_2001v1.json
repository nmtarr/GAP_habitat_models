Water is almost always present in the form of pools, ponds, lakes, or other slow-moving bodies (Dunn and Garrett 1997). They prefer the presence of cypress however, other common overstory habitat includes willows, tupelo, gums, elms, and maples (Petit 1999, Turcott & Watts 1999). Builds nest inside a cavity of a tree, inside a stump, in the hollowed top of a broken tree (Pearson 1959), or in a cypress knee (Nicholson 1997). Will do some excavation in rotten stumps (Ehrlich et al. 1988). Often uses old woodpecker holes, particularly those of the Downy woodpecker (Griscom and Sprunt 1957). Will also use nest boxes (Ehrlich et al. 1988) and bird houses, or occasionally nest in sheltered places such as under bridges or in boat houses (Griscom and Sprunt 1957). The nest cavity is often located over water (Ehrlich et al. 1988), but may be far from it (Dunn and Garrett 1997), although those far from water may be in easily flooded areas (Griscom and Sprunt 1957). The cavity is usually less than 6 feet from the ground but may be over 25 feet (Dunn and Garrett 1997). Gleans the foliage of reeds, bushes, limbs overhanging streams (Pearson 1959), rotten logs, and around the edges of water (Dunn and Garrett 1997).\r\nKey (and nearly universal) features are presence of water near wooded area with suitable cavity nest sites. Nest usually placed over or near large bodies of standing or slow-moving water, including seasonally flooded bottomland hardwood forest, bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) swamps, and large rivers or lakes (Walkinshaw 1953, Blem and Blem 1991). Many other forms of water also chosen, such as creeks, streams, backyard ponds, and even swimming pools. Water depth under nests highly variable. In Illinois, water depth below most nests 8\u201360 cm (n = 22; Kleen 1973). Nests located away from water are usually in low-lying, temporarily flooded spots (Walkinshaw 1953). Other important habitat correlates include low elevation, flat terrain, shaded forest habitats with sparse understory, and in some places, presence of bald cypress (Kahl et al. 1985, Robbins et al. 1989). Common overstory trees in nesting habitat include willows (Salix), maples (Acer), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), willow oak (Quercus phellos), ashes (Fraxinus), elms (Ulmus), river birch (Betula nigra), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), cypress, and other species associated with wetlands. Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) is the most common subcanopy species. Canopy height 12\u201340 m (usually 16\u201320), canopy cover usually 50\u201375%; ground vegetation usually very sparse and of low stature (<0.5 m; Kahl et al. 1985). Exhibits area sensitivity, avoiding forests <100 ha in area and avoiding waterways with wooded borders <30 m wide (Kahl et al. 1985)(quoted directly from Petit 1999).\r\n\r\nWinter:\r\nPrimarily mangrove swamps throughout winter range, where usually is the most abundant migratory species, along with Northern Waterthrush (Seiurus novaboracensis; Russell 1980, Lefebvre et al. 1992, 1994). Also occurs regularly in lower abundance in dry tropical forest, residential areas, and wooded stream corridors in pasture lands near coastal areas (Keast and Morton 1980, Faaborg and Arendt 1984 . LJP and D. Petit unpubl.). Sometimes moves out of drier habitats into moister habitats, including highlands, in dry season (Jan\u2013Mar; Johnson 1980, Lefebvre and Poulin 1996)(quoted directly from Petit 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bPROWx", "ELCode": "ABPBX07010", "scientific_name": "Protonotaria citrea", "ITIS_TSN": "178846", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100372", "common_name": "Prothonotary Warbler"}}
