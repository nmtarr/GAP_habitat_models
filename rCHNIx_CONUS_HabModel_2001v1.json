It can also be found in arid and semiarid plains, hillsides, and canyons where the terrain is relatively hilly, rocky, and that includes sandy or gravelly soils (Degenhardt et al. 1996; Hammerson 1999; Stebbins 2003; Werler and Dixon 2000). Prolonged periods of inactivity are spent under surface, in crevices, rocks, or underground. This species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and ground litter.\r\n\r\nFrom Crothers et al 2012 regarding H torquata (modeled by ReGAP efforts) and 3 modeled species \"The nominal species H. torquata is now restricted to Mexico, three described forms occur in the USA, and the undescribed form is endemic to the Cochise Filter Barrier area of southeastern Arizona and associated New Mexico\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rCHNIx", "ELCode": "ARADB18040", "scientific_name": "Hypsiglena jani", "ITIS_TSN": "174232", "Global_SEQ_ID": "817057", "common_name": "Chihuahuan Nightsnake"}}
