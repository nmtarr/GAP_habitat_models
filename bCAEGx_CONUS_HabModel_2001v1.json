Many heronries are adjacent to water, on the shoreline or on islands in any water type, and they are typically of four basic types 1) woodlands, 2) wooded islands in inland water bodies such as reservoirs, 3) swamps, wet thickets, or wetlands, and 4) trees and shrubs on natural or dredge-material created coastal islands (Telfair 2006).\r\n\r\nThe vegetation described at nest-sites in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas included; swamps of red maple (Acer rubra), common buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), water tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water-elm (Planera aquatica), willow (Salix spp.), and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum); coastal islands and estuarine swamps of eastern baccharis (Baccharis halmifolia), sea-oxeye (Borrichia frutescens), bayberry (Myrica spp.), common reed (Phragmites communis), mangroves (Avicennia germinans, Rhizophora mangle), and blueberry (Vaccinium sp.); and wooded uplands, riparian corridors, and inland islands of sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), ashes (Fraxinus spp.), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginianus), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), osage orange (Maclura pomifera),  American sycamore (Plantanus occidentalis), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), oaks (Quercus spp.), common elderberry (Sambucus nigra), and elms (Ulmus spp.; Telfair 2006).\r\n\r\nCattle Egrets are rare vagrants throughout much of the southwestern U.S., including the Southwest lowlands.  When observed, they have been in aquatic and agricultural habitats: freshwater and saltwater marshes, wet meadows and grassy pastures (especially near livestock), swamps, around parks, reservoirs, and ponds.  Vegetation described at nest-sties in North Dakota, Wyoming, Iowa, Nevada, and Arizona included boxelder (Acer negundo), cottonwood (Populus spp.), willows (Salix spp.), bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), and saltcedar (Tamarix gallica) in wetlands.  Inundated, dead Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), citrus groves, and stands of Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila) have been also been used, albeit opportunistically (Telfair 2006).  In Colorado they are sometimes seen during fall migration and spring migration on the eastern plains, and they may be fairly common to common very locally during late summer and early fall in locations such as at lower Latham Reservoir, in Weld, Colorado.  They are also rare in Colorado\u2019s western valleys and the San Luis Valley, but casual in other mountain parks.  In Nevada, they are uncommon residents in selected localities, but there are many summer records near Halleck and Ruby Lake, Nevada.  They are an uncommon summer resident in Utah.\r\n\r\nMigration and winter habitat for the Cattle Egret is similar to its foraging habitat (Telfair 2006).  N.
