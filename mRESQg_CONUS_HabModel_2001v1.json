Graham Red Squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis) is an Endangered subspecies of Red Squirrel that only occurs in the Pinaleno mountains of AZ (USFWS 2011).  They once ranged east to Turkey Flat and west to West Peak, but now only as far west as Clark Peak.  Historically found in mature and old-growth high-elevation, closed-canopy, mixed conifer and spruce-fir forests, most individuals currently inhabit mixed-conifer forests.  Their population has been declining due to insect outbreaks, wildfires, and fire suppression.  Middens have been found up to 3,268 m and as low as 2,353 m, but they are believed to have historically resided above 2,425 m.  A habitat suitability model was built for this subspecies and it associated the species with mixed conifer forests, ecotones, and spruce-fir forests above 2,744m or above 2,353 on north or east aspect slopes with less than a 45-degree slope (USFWS 2011).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mRESQg", "ELCode": "AMAFB08011", "scientific_name": "Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis", "ITIS_TSN": "202353", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101915", "common_name": "Mt.
