Its range extends north up to Illinois. Isolated populations occur in south and central Missouri. The green treefrog has been introduced to the northwestern part of Puerto Rico (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999; Conant and Collins 1998). Found in the bay region of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida; also occurs in the Mississippi River drainage, north from Louisiana and Mississippi through floodplains in Arkansas, western Tennessee, Kentucky, southeastern Missouri and Illinois (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nPreferred habitats are edges of streams and lakes, while also found in swamps, floating vegetation or nearby vegetation. Very general habitat requirements are added moisture and dampness (Conant and Collins 1998). For breeding, habitats are characterized by flowing vegetation, shrubs, and trees found along swamps, marshes, sloughs, lakes, and ponds (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGRTRx", "ELCode": "AAABC02060", "scientific_name": "Hyla cinerea", "ITIS_TSN": "173505", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105168", "common_name": "Green Treefrog"}}
