American Midland Naturalist 149: 384-394."}, "habitat_description": "Southwest:\r\nNarrative description of distribution:  Hoffmeister (1986) was used as the primary source for delimiting range.  The Mammalian Species Account (Spencer and Cameron 1982) predated Hoffmeister (1986) by four years.  For New Mexico, Findley et al. (1975) and Cook (1986) were consulted.  This range is more narrowly defined than is depicted by the use of HUCs.  Range is overestimated in the northern extent of its range in both southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico.  There is little information regarding the range of this species.  This species is known to occur within southeastern Arizona, and extreme southern New Mexico (Spencer and Cameron 1982).  In Arizona, Hoffmeister (1959) trapped this species in Cochise (n = 8), Santa Cruz (n = 16) and Pima Counties (n = 1).  In the Huachuca Mountains, this species was observed at the mouths of Miller (n = 2) and Ramsey Canyons (n  = 1) and at Broken Arrow Ranch, Miller Canyon (n = 1; Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954).  In New Mexico, this species is known to occur in the Animas (Cook 1986) and Peloncillo Mountains, Hidalgo County (Findley et al. 1975; Cook 1986).\r\nVegetation Type:  Mesquite and desert grassland vegetation types described as (1) grassy slopes and alluvial fans amid scattered oaks and other deciduous trees, (2) hillsides within gramma and other grasses and scattered beargrass, mesquite and yucca, (3) grassy, rocky alluvial fans containing oak- and pinyon-covered canyons, (4) desert shrubland, and (5) oak-juniper woodlands.\r\nElevational Range:  On the Peloncillo Mountains, New Mexico, this species was trapped at 5,900 feet elevation (Findley and Pullen 1958).  Because there is only one site specific location which represents an infinitesimally small n-value, this information does not satisfy EDR 5.  Consequently, this information will be excluded from further analysis.\r\nSensitivity to Human Disturbance:  In the Sonoita Valley, Santa Cruz County, this species was trapped significantly more often in ungrazed warm-season perennial bunchgrasses characterized by Aristida, Bouteloua, Eragrostis, Heteropogon, Hilaria and Lycurus, than in grazed shrubland characterized by scattered mesquite (Prosopis velutina), and a variety of emergent succulents including Agave palmeri, Yucca elata and Dasylirion wheeleri  (Z = 2.21; P < 0.05; Jones et al. 2003).   Dogs and humans did not greatly disturb this species, as they can become accustomed to their presence (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954).  \r\nAssessment:  There is a paucity of data regarding the habitat requirements of this species. References used in drafting this habitat description include the American Society of Mammalogists\u2019 species account (Spencer and Cameron 1982), three peer reviewed journal articles (Findley and Pullen 1968; Hoffmeister 1959; Jones et al. 2003), and four natural history accounts (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954; Findley et al. 1975; Cook 1986; Hoffmeister 1986).  Vegetation information was derived from two peer reviewed journal articles (Findley and Pullen 1968; Hoffmeister 1959), and three natural history accounts (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954; Findley et al. 1975; Hoffmeister 1986).  Elevation was derived from one peer reviewed journal article (Findley and Pullen 1968).  Sensitivity to human disturbance was derived from one peer-reviewed journal article (Jones et al. 2003) and one natural history account (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954).  Findley and Pullen (1958) trapped this mouse on the Peloncillo Mountains, 22 miles south and two miles east of Rodeo, Hidalgo County, from 27-30 January 1957.   Hoffmeister and Goodpaster (1954) conducted a mammal study in the Huachuca Mountains; field observations were made and specimens were collected by W.W. Goodpaster and L.W. Goodpaster in August 1949, August 1950, 31 July-3 August 1951, by D.F. Hoffmeister and R.G. Van Gelder 09 August \u2013 01 September 1950, 31 July \u2013 03 August 1951 and by D.F. Hoffmeister for seven days in December 1952.  Hoffmeister (1959) vaguely indicates fieldwork over the past several years, in both summer and winter, was conducted in southern Arizona.  Cook (1986) conducted a small mammal trapping study on the Animas Mountains; traps were placed within the major habitats of the mountains and trapping was conducted 26 February \u2013 01 March 1981, 18 - 21 March 1981, 18 May \u2013 05 August 1981, 07 \u2013 13 October 1981, 19 December 1981 \u2013 12 January 1982 and 12 \u2013 17 March 1982.  This effort represented 11,000 trap nights.  Jones et al.  (2003) conducted a study in grazed and ungrazed grassland plots on and adjacent to the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch in Sonoita Valley, Santa Cruz County, Arizona with a total sampling effort of 5760 trap nights.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nFulvous harvest mouse occur primarily in grassy fields containing shrubs (Spencer and Cameron 1982). Additional habitat for this species includes fencrows, thickets, and pine-grass ecotones (Chaote et al. 1994, Wilson and Ruff 1999, Spencer and Cameron 1982).\r\nEcosystem Classifiers: Disturbed grasslands, Evergreen.\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, this species occurs admist tangles of grasses, weeds, and shrubs along creek bottoms. In Big Bend Ranch State Park they can be found within riparian woodlands, and mesquite desert scrub often traveling via small trails used be other associated small mammal species such as cotton and rice rats and white-footed mice. They live in underground burrows as well as arboreal refugia constructed out of existing material such as abandoned bird nests (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mFHMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF02050", "scientific_name": "Reithrodontomys fulvescens", "ITIS_TSN": "180341", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101839", "common_name": "Fulvous Harvest Mouse"}}
