Ranges widely to forage over both forest and open areas in montane habitats (Subtropical and Temperate zones; Am. Ornithol. Union 1998). In British Columbia, found from 0 to 2,600 m (Campbell et al. 1990); in California, from 0 to 2,300 m (Small 1994).\r\nMost documented nesting sites are associated with sheer cliffs and waterfalls (Lowther and Collins, 2002). This species is not considered an abundant summer resident. May use inland sites near or behind waterfalls in mountains. Specialize in foraging on nuptial flight swarms of fat-rich winged reproductive ants.  May also feed on caddisflies, mayflies, flesh flies, and hymenopterans.  Species is critically imperiled in NM and UT(NatureServe). The appearance of this species coincides with prominent weather conditions such as barometric pressure, wind direction, and precipitation.  As of 1910: The black swift breeds from southern British Columbia and southern Colorado to central Mexico; assumed to winter in southern Mexico, but not known; needs 5 characteristics for nesting sites: water, high relief, inaccessibility, darkness, and unobstructed flyways (Knorr, 1961).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBLSWx", "ELCode": "ABNUA01010", "scientific_name": "Cypseloides niger", "ITIS_TSN": "177997", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101434", "common_name": "Black Swift"}}
