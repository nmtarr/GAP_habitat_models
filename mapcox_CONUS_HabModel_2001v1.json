In the southern Appalachians this species is associated with conifer/heath habitat, especially mountain laurel and blueberry (Whitaker Jr. and Hamilton Jr. 1998). In Alabama it frequents mountain slopes and associated foothills (Wilson and Ruff 1999) in Bankhead National Forest (Lawrence County), Choccolocco Mt. (Calhoun County) and the Black Pond area of Winston County at elevations as low as 213m . Nests may be constructed in underground burrows or open depressions.  They breed in spring and summer and gestation lasts about 28 days. They annually produce 2-3 litters averaging 5 young.", "taxanomic": {"gap_code": "mAPCOx", "ELCode": "AMAEB01090", "scientific_name": "Sylvilagus obscurus", "ITIS_TSN": "552514", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101018", "common_name": "Appalachian Cottontail"}, "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strEdgeType": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5"}}
