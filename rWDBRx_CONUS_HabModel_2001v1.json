Also found in Lower Colorado River Desertscrub, Great Basin Conifer Woodland and Madrean Evergreen Woodland. Prefers rocky ground or bajadas (Brennan and Holycross 2009). Described to be abundant in suburban habitats and to use riverbeds, canals, ditches to move into populated areas. Mostly abundant on grassy or scrubby rangelands (Bartlett and Tennant 2000). This species ranges from Southeastern California to Arkansas and East Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Also found South to North Sinaloa and San Luis Potosi. Found from sea level up to 2500m (Stebbins 2003). Conant and Collins (1998) described the Western diamondback rattlesnake to be mainly found in lowlands but also able to climb to altitudes of 1500m or more.  In New Mexico, this species is widely spread the state except in the northern border areas and on the Mogollon Plateau. It ranges from 900 to about 2350 meters, and may also be found at 2500 meters in Rio Arriba county (Degenhardt et al. 1996). In Texas, this species has been collected at an altitude of 1371 meters and is considered to be found at a maximum altitude of 1829 meters on the slopes and canyons of the Davis Mountains in Jeff Davis County. It occupies desert flats, brush-covered plains, mesquite and creosote covered intermesa valleys, rolling hills, cedar-covered mesa tops, thorny thickets, rocky canyons, sandstone outcroppings, river bluffs, rocky mountain foothills, and plant-covered sand dunes (Dixon and Werler 2000).\r\n\r\nArizona Upland Desertscrub and Chihuahuan desertscrub. Also found in Lower Colorado River Desertscrub, Great Basin Conifer Woodland and Madrean Evergreen Woodland (Brennan and Holycross 2009). Mesquite and creosote covered intermesa valleys, cedar-covered mesa tops, and plant-covered sand dunes (Dixon and Werler 2000). Associated with cacti and thornbushes, mesquite, palo verde, grasses, and even riparian oak groves (Ernst 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWDBRx", "ELCode": "ARADE02020", "scientific_name": "Crotalus atrox", "ITIS_TSN": "174310", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101695", "common_name": "Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake"}}
