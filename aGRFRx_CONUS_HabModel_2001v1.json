Introduced to lower Fraser Valley and at Victoria, Vancouver I., and at Duncan, Coombs, and on Texada I., British Columbia. Also in Toad Lake, Whatcom County, Lake Washington, King County, and Lake Gillette, Stevens County in Washington. Introduced also along lower Weber River in Ogden Utah (Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). \r\n\r\nFound usually along the shoreline of marshes, lakes, ponds, rills, creeks, ditches, springs, and streams. Strongly associated with brooks and small streams (Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). Juveniles are most common in less densely vegetated areas than adults (Martof 1953). Adults are generally found along shorelines and banks of permanent bodies of water, but also marshes, springs, quarry, and farm ponds (Lannoo 2005). Minton (1972) reported adults to rarely move more than a meter away from water. This species prefers shallow water such as swamps and can also be found in fallen trees and decaying vegetation (Behler and King 1979). Preferred breeding habitat are shorelines of lakes and permanent bodies of water such as bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, ponds, and streams (Lannoo 2005). Furthermore, oviposition is strongly associated with shallow waters among emergent vegetation along the shores (cattails, sedges, and rushes) (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGRFRx", "ELCode": "AAABH01090", "scientific_name": "Lithobates clamitans", "ITIS_TSN": "775087", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102178", "common_name": "Green Frog"}}
