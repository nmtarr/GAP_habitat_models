Also, from southeast Arizona to east and northwest Texas (Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). In Arizona, is found in flatlands and valleys found in the Chihuahuan Desertscrub and Semidesert Grassland communities (Brennan and Holycross 2009). Most localities are found below 1524 meters (Lannoo 2005). In Kansas, this species is found in open grass plains and native prairie vegetation with significant topographic relief (Collins 1982; Taggart 1997). In New Mexico, populations are established in mesquite and creosote bush communities, but similarly distributed in playa bottom grasslands to open bajada creosote bush associations (Degenhardt et al. 1996); arid and semiarid grasslands in Texas (Garrett and Barker 1987); short grass plains and mixed prairies in Oklahoma (Lannoo 2005). Localities in Mexico are found in xerophilic brushland and grassland (Flores-Villela 1993).\r\nFound mainly in arid and semiarid plains, foothills, and valleys. Also distributed across mesquite savanna, creosote bush flats, and grasslands. Spawning pools are often treeless or with scattered vegetation surrounding them. Associated with rains, this toad can be found in intermittent streams and temporary pools, and irrigation ditches and reservoirs (Stebbins 2003).Only seen away from pools during heavy rains (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding occurs opportunistically after heavy summer rains in temporary water sources that include roadside ditches, stock tanks, and shallow pools within intermittent rivers (Lannoo 2005).\r\nThe western subspecies, A. debilis insidior usually occurs at higher elevations (above 760m) and in drier conditions than the eastern counterpart, A. debilis debilis. Found in the Chihuahuan Desert and neighboring areas of west Kansas and southeast Arizona to Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi (Conant and Collins 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGRTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01060", "scientific_name": "Anaxyrus debilis", "ITIS_TSN": "773518", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102043", "common_name": "Green Toad"}}
