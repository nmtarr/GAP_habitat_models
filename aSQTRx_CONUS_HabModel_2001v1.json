Considered a common species, it can be found in sugar cane fields, wells, corn fields, below eaves of roofs, outhouses, and barns (Mount 1975 in Lannoo 2005). Breeding habitat includes woodland and pasture wetlands, roadside ditches, or stock ponds where individuals are found on the shorelines or in vegetation or hiding in clumps of grass (Lannoo 2005). \r\nThis species in particular is found utilizing a wide variety of habitats that include houses, in and around other buildings, trash piles, grasslands, pinelands, trees, open woodlands, gardens, weed tangles, vines, bromeliad plants, riparian zones, cypress stands. In general, moisture is the only requirement. Only reported preference is mature pine and mixed hammock forests, or other open woodlands. May also prefer plant associations of longleaf pine/slash pine and longleaf pine/turkey oat/wiregrass.\r\n\r\nThis is species also occupies coastal estuarine and harsh barrier island habitat and can survive in brackish water. For example, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina individuals are found perched on floating logs in shallow waters that are surrounded by dry, unvegetated sand in the wrack zone. Water in site where tadpoles of the squirrel treefrog were found in Bogue Bank North Carolina was determined to be 47% sea water (Neill 1958; Webb 1965 in Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSQTRx", "ELCode": "AAABC02120", "scientific_name": "Hyla squirella", "ITIS_TSN": "173504", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106239", "common_name": "Squirrel Treefrog"}}
