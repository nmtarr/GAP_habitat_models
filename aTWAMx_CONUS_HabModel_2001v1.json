The two-toed amphiuma can be found a variety of lowland and even some isolated upland water bodies of the coastal plain.  Specimens have been found on some barrier islands (Gibbons and Coker 1978) and in the sandhills subregion (Garton and Sill 1977). These eel-like salamanders require lowland, acid water with a soft, muddy bottom.  They are normally absent from rivers with substantial current.  Presence of crayfish burrows probably important (Salthe 1973).   Often found in root masses of water hyacinths and other aquatic plants (Petranka). They are not in the rivers of southern Florida and do not occur in waters with any saline influence (Duellman and Schwartz 1958).  A. means has the capability of moving overland, but is limited by terrain and distance to isolated ponds. Therefore, it is primarily found within bottomlands and among low-lying wet sites at the margins of bottoms.   Eggs are laid January-February in north, June-July in south.  Eggs are laid at the bottom of seasonal ponds during drying periods. Eggs become encased in hardened mud until rains flood site and induce hatching. The female remains with eggs during most of incubation (about 5 months).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aTWAMx", "ELCode": "AAAAB01010", "scientific_name": "Amphiuma means", "ITIS_TSN": "173609", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104318", "common_name": "Two-toed Amphiuma"}}
