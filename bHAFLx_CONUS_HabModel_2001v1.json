Fairly common spring migrant in the lower Colorado River Valley. Tend to stay fairly high in conifers during the breeding season, in winter live along the Bill Williams River in the lower Colorado River Valley in Arizona (Rosenberg et al. 1991). Uncommon throughout New Mexico in summer and fall; no records of nesting (Ligon 1961). Is a summer resident in mountain forest in Nevada (Alcorn, 1988). In Colorado, is a summer resident in high mountains and migratory at lower elevations (Andrews and Righter 1992). In Colorado, breeds mainly in mature, closed-canopy spruce-fir forests; may also occur in ponderosa pine forests (Andrews and Righter 1992). In Colorado also found in breeding season in mixed coniferous-aspen forests, pure aspen forests with limited understory, lodgepole pine and douglas-fir forests (Andrews and Righter 1992). During migration, this species will occupy all wooded habitats in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992). In the mountains of southern Colorado, this species can be found breeding in aspen as well as coniferous forests, at about 2438-3048 m (Andrews and Righter 1992). These birds are migratory in western Arizona, where they remain close to the ground where they pounce on small insects from low, shaded branches; may winter in willows along the rivers in this area (Beaver and Baldwin 1975).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nInhabits cool forest and woodland, breeding primarily in dense fir (Am. Ornithol. Union 1983); mature coniferous or mixed forests to near timberline (Godfrey 1986); conifer and aspen forests (Hayward et al. 1976); dense conifers and broadleafed vegetation (alders [Alnus spp.]) and dogwood [Cornus spp.) with numerous canopy openings; dense coniferous woods in w. Washington and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and mixed coniferous-deciduous forests in e. Washington (Larrison and Sonnenberg 1968) and ne. Oregon (Mannan 1984). Breeds throughout coniferous forests (ponderosa pine, spruce-fir, lodgepole pine [P. contorta], and Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii]) and in coniferous-aspen and pure aspen in Colorado from 2,100 to 3,000 m (Bailey and Niedrach 1965, Beaver and Baldwin 1975, Andrews and Righter 1992)(quoted directly from Sedgwick 1994). Also breeds in Douglas-fir habitat in mts. Of North Coast down to about 600 m (2000 ft)(Grinnell and Miller 1944, Garrett and Dunn 1981).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bHAFLx", "ELCode": "ABPAE33080", "scientific_name": "Empidonax hammondii", "ITIS_TSN": "554254", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100912", "common_name": "Hammond's Flycatcher"}}
