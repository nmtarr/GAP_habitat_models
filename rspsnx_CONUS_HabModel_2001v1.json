Populations have also been reported at the southern end of Vancouver Island and the nearby Gulf Islands of British Columbia.  This species can be found along the Coast Ranges; south into San Luis Obispo County, Sierra Nevada south to Tulare County; Willamette Valley, Oregon; the east side of the Cascades in Washington. The elevational range of this species extends from sea level to approximately 2010 meters (Feldman and Hoyer 2010; Stebbins 2003; St. John 2002).\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits a wide variety of environments. From riparian situations to savanna and various woodland types. It occurs in bare rock, talus, scree, forest woodland, grassland, shrubland, chaparral, conifer woodland, and oak woodland (Natureserve.org). Stebbins (2003) has reported the habitats preferred by this snake include moist situations in pastures, meadows, oak woodlands, and along the edges of hardwood and coniferous forests. Weaver (2004), as reported by Natureserve.org, documented occurrences of this species in shrubby rabbitbrush-sagebrush.\r\n\r\n\r\nNW\t-Conifer forests, oak woodland, and moist situations in pastures.\r\nSW\t-Grassland, shrubland, and chaparral, and along riparian zones.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSPSNx", "ELCode": "ARADB09010", "scientific_name": "Contia tenuis", "ITIS_TSN": "174220", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100404", "common_name": "Sharp-tailed Snake"}}
