This species is restricted to oak savannah habitat containing large trees scattered among broad expanses of open ground. Range completely within an area experiencing a Mediterranean type climate with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters, to which it is physiologically adapted (Hayworth and Weathers 1984). Most common in valley floors, along gentle slopes, and in open areas with large trees either scattered and parklike or along stream courses (Grinnell and Miller 1944). Large insects and accessible water must be present all year (Grinnell and Miller 1944). Forages in grassland, pasture, cultivated fields, and orchards (Linsdale 1937, Grinnell and Miller 1944, Verbeek 1973, Reynolds 1990)(quoted directly from Koenig and Reynolds 2009). Inhabits valley foothill hardwood, valley foothill hardwood-conifer, valley foothill riparian, orchard vineyard, cropland, pasture, and urban habitats. Verbeek (1973) reported home range in Monterey Co. averaged about 40 ha (100 ac) during breeding season, and expanded to about 607 ha (1500 ac) in nonbreeding season (quoted directly from Green et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bYBMAx", "ELCode": "ABPAV09020", "scientific_name": "Pica nuttalli", "ITIS_TSN": "179723", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104725", "common_name": "Yellow-billed Magpie"}}
