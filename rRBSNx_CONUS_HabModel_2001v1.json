Typical habitats includes hardwood forests and mixed-hardwood pine forests (Wilson 1995, Mitchell 1994).  S.o. obscura  will also occupy pine flatwoods, open deciduous forests, old fields, bogs, and borders of marshes and swamps (Palmer & Braswell 1995, Ernst and Barbour 1989, Wilson 1995, snakes of Florida).
