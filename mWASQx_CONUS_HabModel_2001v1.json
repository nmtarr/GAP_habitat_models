Food availability and soil characteristics are the most important influences on colony occurrence (Betts 1990), but only certain plant communities are suitable; ones with a relatively high coverage of sagebrush, rabbitbrush, or perennial bunchgrass on Warden soils (Greene et al. 2009).  The Boardman Bombing Range, Morrow County, Oregon is important habitat; they inhabit areas with some big sagebrush (Aretmisia tridentate), downy wheatgrass (Agropyron dasytachyum), and needle and thread grass (Stipa comate; Rohwelder and Melland 1979).  Greene et al. (2009) found squirrels in sagebrush, bunchgrass, and low shrub communities but not in bitterbrush or annual grass communities and they were more abundant in sagebrush than bunchgrass or low shrub communities.  They are most abundant where there is high grass cover, deep soil with low clay content, and high silt content.  At the microhabitat scale, they are negatively correlated with area of bare ground, positively correlated with vegetation cover, and positively correlated with amount of silt in the soil (Greene et al. 2009).  This species has suffered from habitat conversion to agricultural use; the removal of vegetation and tilling destroy the soil structure that it requires (NatureServe 2014).  Invasion by noxious weeds, fire, and intensive grazing degrade habitat as well (Betts 1990).  Remaining suitable habitat has been fragmented by pasture, irrigated crop lands, and other human developments (Betts 1999).  N.
