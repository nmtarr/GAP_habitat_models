They are common in forested and open situations, more commonly in the latter, from lowlands to mountains (AOU 1983). They are more numerous in lowland areas perhaps for the greater abundance of breeding sites, such as thickets and hollow trees (Palmer 1988).  Potter et al (1980) refers to remote woodlands and swamps as breeding areas for these vultures. They are found frequently near highways scavenging animals that have been killed by motor vehicles (Potter et al 1980).\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania and Maryland, Turkey Vultures nested in areas that were roadless, forested, and undeveloped (Coleman and Fraser 1989).  But they also nest on the ground in dense shrubbery (especially in eastern U.S.), sometimes in or under abandoned building in woods (Jackson 1983, Palmer 1988) and may use abandoned hawk nests (Hilty and Brown 1986).  Like the Black Vulture, no real attempt is made to build a nest (Ehrlich et al 1988).  Eggs are laid in cavities in living or dead trees, rocky ledges, caves, wooded thickets, or abandoned buildings (Hamel 1992, Potter et al 1980).  Palmer (1988) described roosts as being near stable food sources, near or over water, and often including hundreds of birds.  In southern Pennsylvania and northern Maryland, the mean home range was 37,072 ha (using convex polygon). The summer home ranges was 27,050 ha, winter home range was 12,773 ha, and breeding home range was 6,942 ha (Coleman & Fraser 1989).\r\n\r\nIn the western United States, this species tends to occur in areas of pastured rangeland, non-intensive agriculture, or wild areas with rock outcrops suitable for nesting (Kirk and Mossman 1998).  Other suitable microhabitats for nests include on the ground under vegetation, under overhanging ledges, on mountain or canyon slopes, and in fallen, hollow logs, broken tree stumps, or caves (Ligon 1961, Glinski 1998).  They roost in trees, on posts, or rock ledges to sun.  Roosts are often communal in cottonwoods, tamarisk, eucalyptus, exposed boulders, and use electrical towers (Glinski 1998).  \r\n\r\nThis species is widely distributed throughout Utah and will usually nests in caves along mountain ranges (Hayward et al. 1976).  It is a common to uncommon resident of the entire state of Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  In Arizona, these birds do not seem to prefer any particular habitat type (Glinski 1998).  It is found at all elevations in Arizona in summer (Glinski 1998).  Roosts are usually in riparian areas (Glinski 1998).  It is often found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona (Franzreb and Ohmart 1978).  In New Mexico, it is a resident from early March to mid-October (Ligon 1961).  In the southern part of the state, it frequents plains grassland, semi-desert grassland, Chihuahuan desert scrub, pinyon-juniper woodland, agricultural and urban areas (Eakle et al. 1996).  It is a common summer resident in Arizona except in extensive forested areas where it is uncommon or locally rare (Phillips et al. 1978).  In Colorado, this species is fairly numerous in the summer but is uncommon in winter (Bailey and Niedrach 1965).  Its range has expanded north recently in Colorado because of the large amount of roadkill, which it feasts upon (Kingery 1998).  It is known to nest at 3,657 m in elevation (Bailey and Niedrach 1965) and on cliffs (Kingery 1998).  It forages over most open habitats, such as such as grasslands, shrublands, and agricultural areas soaring while searching for carrion.  Any habitat in the lower Colorado River Valley could be used, and they even inhabit extremely dry deserts, grasslands, and temperate forests (Rosenberg et al. 1991, Kingery 1998).  \r\n\r\nCompiled from regional habitat notes by N.
