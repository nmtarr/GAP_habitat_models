Coniferous swamps and second-growth areas that are adjacent to mature forests, alder fens, and conifer bogs are also utilized. They are often found in ecotones.  Underground burrows generally are avoided and nesting places may be made in a ground depression or hollow log.  Across the range, breeding season extends from February to mid-August. The young are born May-August.  Litter size is 1-6 (averages 3) with 1-4 litters per year.  Young are weaned at about 4 weeks.  Litters stay at natal sites for up to a few days or a week and gradually range farther away.  Sexual maturity is reached in the first spring (second calendar year).  They usually live no more than about 2 years, but can live up to 5 years.
