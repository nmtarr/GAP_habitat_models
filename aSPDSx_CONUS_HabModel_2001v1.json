At lower elevations individuals are often abundant in or about seeps, or along margins of small streams with rocks, logs, mosses, and other cover.  In mountainous regions, these salamanders are often found several meters from the waters edge. It is generally rare above 1200m in elevation (previously D. fuscus) (Petranka 1998).  Courtship may occur both in fall and spring. Oviposition peaks in July in many areas. Clutch size often 10-30. Eggs attended by female. Larvae hatch in 5-9 weeks (Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio) or 10-13 weeks (Ohio), metamorphose 6-13 months later (in June or July in Ohio). Sexually mature in 2-3 years.  The larval stage is aquatic.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSPDSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03041", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus conanti", "ITIS_TSN": "668240", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102338", "common_name": "Spotted Dusky Salamander"}}
