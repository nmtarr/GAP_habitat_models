Rarely down to sea level, or above tree line in rocky alpine areas (Bowles and Decker 1927). Typical habitat is coniferous forest, with various dominant species of pines (Pinus), hemlocks (Tsuga), firs (Abies), and spruces (Picea); representative canopy species, depending on locality and altitude, include sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), red fir (Abies magnifica), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). In Rocky Mtns., occurs in all major coniferous forest communities, including mixed-conifer, spruce-fir, and cedar-hemlock (Thuja - Tsuga) (Hutto 1995). At Eagle Lake, Lassen Co., CA, uniformly distributed along elevational gradient from pure pine stands (Ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa], Jeffrey pine [P. jeffreyi]) at 1,575 m to stands dominated by white fir (Abies concolor) and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) at 1,815 m, with no apparent preference between the 2 stand types. Less commonly in mixed conifer-deciduous forest, such as pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forest in Mexico or pines with quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) in Rocky Mtns. Prefers relatively open stands to dense forest, including areas thinned by light burns or selective logging, usually with sparse shrub layer and little vegetative ground cover. Does not avoid forest edges, e.g., at tree line or near openings of chaparral or scree fields. In Douglas fir forests in nw. California, prefers pole-sawtimber or mature stands (>20 yr since disturbance) and rarely uses early successional brush-sapling patches, but in Rocky Mtns. often found in early-successional (<10 yr since disturbance) and midsuccessional (10\u201340 yr since disturbance) forests resulting from fires or clear-cuts (Raphael et al. 1988, Hutto 1995)(quoted directly from Bowen 1997).\r\nIn winter, Townsend's solitaires are generally found at lower altitudes than in breeding season, from sea level in coastal areas to 2,000 m in mountain valleys. Primary winter habitat is juniper or pi\u00f1on-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus) woodlands, which provide preferred or exclusive winter food resource, juniper berries. Dominant species varies with locality, includes one-seed juniper (J. monosperma), western juniper (J. occidentalis), or Rocky Mountain juniper (J. scopulorum). Ecotone areas with scattered tall pines are preferred over pure juniper woodland, and steeply sloped canyon walls are preferred over level ground (Sullivan 1976, Salomonson and Balda 1977)(quoted directly from Bowen 1997).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nTypical habitat consists of coniferous forests with Pinus spp., Abies spp., and Picea spp (Bowen 1997). Will nest at high elevations (about 2750 m) on rock ledges or exposed roots of trees (Bowen 1997). In West Texas: lives mainly in evergreen forests in summer (Oberholser 1994). Favors canyons and mountain slopes in brush and thickets in tree-covered ridges (Oberholser 1994). Near Boulder, Colorado, in breeding season are found in lodgepole pine-engelmann spruce-subalpine fir (Snyder 1950). In Colorado, this species feeds primarily on the berries of the red cedar (Juniperus scopularum) and common juniper (J. communis) (Strong 1983). Found in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998). Found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona (Franzreb and Ohmart 1978).\r\nIn winter: prefers valleys, canyons, and juniper-covered ridges (Oberholser 1994). In western Arizona: in summer occurs primarily in honey mesquite, desert washes, and mixed saltcedar-honey mesquite woodland when mistletoe is present (Rosenberg et al. 1991). Main winter food: juniper berries in Arizona and other parts of the West (Bock 1982). In New Mexico, found in pinyon-juniper ecotones in March and November (Juniperus monosperma, Pinus edulis) (Johnsgard 1979). This species can be found in Colorado in winter in juniper and in Ponderosa pine communities; also in Arizona in winter in similar vegetation types (Strong 1983). Can be found where juniper ranges, as it depends almost entirely on the fleshy cones of junipers for food in the winter (Salomonson and Balda 1977).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bTOSOx", "ELCode": "ABPBJ16010", "scientific_name": "Myadestes townsendi", "ITIS_TSN": "179824", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106360", "common_name": "Townsend's Solitaire"}}
