Found in virtually any habitat, providing there is a terrestrial substrate suitable for burrowing and a body of water nearby suitable for breeding. Fossorial adults inhabit bottomland deciduous forests, conifer forests and woodlands, mixed forest, moist hammock areas, pine savannah, open fields and brushy areas, alpine and subalpine meadows and grassland. The tiger salamander is rare in the low country of Atlantic coast states (Martof et al. 1980). In the coastal plain and sandhills of North Carolina, sandy soil appears to be an important component to the salamander's distribution (Martof et al. 1980, Wilson 1995). Populations are found from sea level to about 3350m in elevation. In the southeastern U.S., requires sandy soils, sandhills, and flatwoods ponds that do not contain fishes.  Found in Florida to limits of mesic-temperate hammock. Current range is but a fraction of historic one. Distribution and abundance in NC has dramatically decreased. Populations in the southeastern United States have been detrimentally affected by deforestation and loss of wetland habitats (Petranka 1998).\r\n\r\nA. tigrinum breeds in shallow ponds and lakes with few to no fish. While foraging and migrating between breeding habitats, the species can be found up 406 m from the nearest pond, although the average distance was 182 m (Semlitsch et al., 2007). Another study documents a median distance of 71 m from water (Madison and Farrand, 1998). Semlitsch (1998) argued that a 164 m buffer would include 95% of ambystomatids. In the eastern United States, A. tigrinum avoids grass and shrub habitats, preferring dense forest canopy (Madison and Farrand, 1998; Semlitsch et al., 2007). Throughout its range, the species relies on the presence of loose or sandy soils for burrowing.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aETSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01140", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma tigrinum", "ITIS_TSN": "173592", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101447", "common_name": "Eastern Tiger Salamander"}}
