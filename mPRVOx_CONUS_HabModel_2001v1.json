General habitat requirements are upland herbaceous fields; grasslands, old agricultural lands and thickets; places where there is suitable cover for runways (Natureserve).  Clearing of forest has allowed this species to increase its distribution and abundance along eastern margin of range with floodplains of rivers serving as dispersal routes in the Southwest (Stalling 1990).  In northeastern Colorado, prairie voles inhabit upland swales, grassy areas, edges of irrigation ditches, and the fringes of wooded riparian habitat consisting of open stands of willow and cottonwood (Fitzgerald et al.  1994).  Along the northern Front Range, prairie voles occupy the grassy understory of shrublands in many foothills canyons (Fitzgerald et al.  1994).   In southeastern Colorado, the animals are found in sage-grassland, grass-forb, and shrub woodland communities (Fitzgerald et al.  1994). Prairie voles in New Mexico have been found in Colfax County in 1968, but this is thought to be a relict population from a more northerly distribution (Findley et al. 1975). In dense vegetation, well-developed, extensive runway systems are formed (Fitzgerald et al., 1994).   The species can construct shallow (usually less than 10 cm) burrow systems in friable soils using such burrows as shelters from which to make periodic foraging expeditions (Fitzgerald et al., 1994).   Nests are placed in burrows, under boards or logs, and above ground in grassy clumps (Natureserve). Prairie voles are unusual in that adults form pair bonds; the male and female jointly defend territories and care for their young. Populations of prairie voles can cycle and often are large in areas of dense ground cover (Fagerstone and Ramey, 1996; Getz et al. 2005). Solomon et al. (2005) did not find a significant relationship between the location of nests and vegetative characteristics in a population in Ohio.  Diet consists almost entirely of vegetation (grasses, forbs) and some insects (NatureServe). Underground tunnel systems frequently are used for feeding on roots (Natureserve). Although voles are herbivorous, dietary items can vary widely geographically and seasonally. Prairie voles can have a major impact on agricultural crops including fruit trees, root vegetables, hay crops, and grain (Pugh et al. 2003).  Annual home range rarely more than 1000 sq m; averages a few hundred sq m (Natureserve).  In Colorado found from 1,220-2,130m (CWSD).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, the M. o. taylori subspecies is known from only nine total specimens collected in the 1980's from Hansford and Lipscomb counties. This subspecie of prairie voles prefer tallgrass prairies, colonizing underground burrows and surface runways obscured by vegetation. They use corn and small grain fields during winter (Schmidly 2004).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nPrairie voles primarily inhabit tall grass prairies, but also breed in fallow fields and pastures. They use alfalfa and soybean fields, weedy areas and road right-of-ways during the breeding seaon. In the presence of the meadow vole, the prairie vole will use more dry and short grass habitats (Getz et. al 2001). From Trani et al. (2007): \"The prairie vole inhabits a diversity of grassland habitats\r\nincluding tall grass prairie communities, abandoned fields and pastures, cultivated fields, fencerows, railroad rights-of-way, roadside corridors, and lawns\u2014wherever grass is sufficiently thick for nesting\r\ncover and runway construction (Getz 1985, Stalling 1990). Where sympatric with meadow voles, (M. pennsylvanicus), prairie voles often are restricted to the more sparsely vegetated sites (Getz 1985). However, in areas where they coexist with cotton rats, (Sigmodon hispidus), the opposite pattern of selection is observed, as prairie voles choose dense grass cover and micro-topographic relief (Stokes 1995). Powerline and transportation corridors are believed to be an important means of dispersal that have provided an opportunity for range expansion of the species range, especially at the periphery (Getz et al. 1978, Sealander and Heidt 1990). It rarely, if ever, is found in woodland habitats.\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPRVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11140", "scientific_name": "Microtus ochrogaster", "ITIS_TSN": "180312", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101287", "common_name": "Prairie Vole"}}
