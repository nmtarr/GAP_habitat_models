In general, the species prefers high structural diversity, with areas of dense shrub cover ideal for nests (Edminster, 1954; Meints, 1991), abundant forbs and grasses for foraging habitat, and flat uplands with little vegetation for leks (Hart et al., 1950). While the plains subspecies is adapted to shrub cover of less than 5% (Prose, 1987), the Columbian subspecies prefers >70% shrub cover in breeding habitat (Giesen, 1987).\r\n\r\nSummer distribution is usually centered around leks, which typically have less vegetation, are flat, and are used over the course of many years (Connelly et al. 1998).  Nests however, are placed in dense vegation (Connelly et al. 1998).\r\n\r\nBirds move into wintering habitat once snow covers open areas: riparian areas, deciduous hardwood shrub draws, a variety of deciduous trees, and open coniferous woodlands (Connelly et al. 1998).  The cover provided by these systems is very important.  Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), cherry, serviceberry, snowberry, sagebrush, hawthorn, willow (Salix spp.), and birch (Betula spp.) are among the plants that make suitable habitat (Connelly et al. 1998).  When snow cover is low, they will forage in open sagebrush, grain fields, and grasslands (Connely et al. 1998).\r\n\r\nThe Plains Sharp-tailed Grouse historically occupied an area dominated by mixed tall and short-grass prairies with abundant deciduous shrubs (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998, NatureServe).  Common grasses include bluestems, bluegrasses, wheat grasses, and needle grasses; common shrubs include rose, cherry, serviceberry, snowberry, sagebrush, and hawthorn (Connelly et al. 1998).  \r\n\r\nPlains Sharp-tailed Grouse require high quality nesting habitats that are comprised of high structural diversity, including grasses, shrubs, and forbs (NatureServe). Broods depend on abundant forbs and insect areas often with high diversity of shrubs and interspersion of cover types (Connelly et al. 1998).  Sharp-tails have been known to nest in alfalfa and wheat but usually in relatively heavy cover, often under a shrub in vegetation at least 30cm high with dense foliage (Connelly et al. 1998). Sites that are chosen for leks are generally associated with disturbed sites and often on sites with less vegetation than surrounding areas (Connelly et al. 1998). The leks are usually found in medium to tall grasslands, or wet meadows (Andrews and Righter 1992). \r\n\r\nDuring the winter the Plains Sharp-tails depend upon riparian areas, deciduous hardwood shrub draws, and deciduous and open coniferous woodlands (Connelly et al. 1998). These areas are critical for feeding, roosting, and providing escape cover (Andrews and Righter 1992, NatureServe). Heavy snowfall triggers the movement of sharp-tails from summer ranges to wintering habitats once summer habitats are blanketed with snow (Connelly et al. 1998).  Food Plots, farm fields, and sites in early succession with dense vegetation structures are important feeding areas (Connelly et al. 1998). \r\n\r\nPrairie Sharp-tailed Grouse are found in central lowlands and prairies.  They inhabit brushy successional stages of deciduous and mixed deciduous-coniferous habitats and are known to use open wetlands for roosting during winter (Connelly et al. 1998).\r\n\r\nThe Columbian Sharp-tail favors habitats in a mesic shrub-steppe and grasslands consisting of a variety of species of shrubs, mountain sagebrush, and gambel oak scrubs (Kingery 1988). Deciduous trees and shrubs such as quaking aspen, serviceberry, snowberry, sagebrush, hawthorn, willow, cherry and birch are also important throughout the range for feeding, roosting, and escape cover (Connelly et al. 1998).  Found in grasses, weeds, oak brush, cherry, wild rose, grain fields and conifers (Ligon 1961).\r\nThe breeding habitats for Columbian Sharp-tails require important components for successful nesting and brood rearing. These components include a mosaic of bunchgrasses (Agropyron spp., Festuca spp., and Elymus spp.), sagebrush (Artemesia spp.), and well developed forbs (Achillea spp., Tragopogon spp., and Balsamorhiza spp.; Connelly et al. 1998, NatureServe). This species has been known to nest in alfalfa and wheat, but usually in relatively heavy cover, often under a shrub in vegetation at least 30cm high with dense foliage (Connelly et al. 1998).  Brood rearing habitats are often found in areas with a high diversity of shrubs and an interspersion of cover types to provide an abundance of forbs and insects essential for chick survival (Connelly et al. 1998).  During mating rituals, leks are often associated with disturbed sites and often on sites with less vegetation than the surrounding areas (Connelly et al. 1998). \r\nColumbian Sharp-tails will remain on summering habitats until snow covers these areas forcing them to move into wintering habitats (Connelly et al. 1998).  The wintering habitat for this species includes riparian areas, deciduous hardwood shrub draws, a variety of deciduous trees, and open coniferous woodlands (Connelly et al. 1998). In mild winters, the Columbian Sharp-tail has been known to utilize croplands and CRP fields (Connelly et al. 1998).  N.
