Gray squirrels also thrive in suburban and residential areas where there are trees. They occur less in young forests and are seldom far from permanent open water. A diversity of nut trees is needed to support high densities. Narrow bands of hardwoods along ephemeral streams are an important component of the habitat in even-aged pine and mixed pine-hardwood stands (Fischer and Holler 1991). Also found in all types of hammock habitat, savannahs, cypress, palm, coastal scrub and swamps (Fernald 1989; Layne 1984; Ivey 1959; Moore 1949). In Virginia, telemetry and live-trapping minimum home range showed the male home averaged 0.53 ha and those of females averaged 0.40 ha (Doebel and McGinnes 1974). Most winter-spring litters are born in tree cavities and most spring-summer litters are born in leaf nests (Teaford 1986). A first litter is produced mostly in February-March and a second litter may be born in July or August. Gestation lasts 44 days. Litter size most often is 2-3. Most gray squirrels breed as yearlings and the reproductive output, including the percentage of adults that produce young and the number of litters/year, is positively correlated with mast abundance. Their maximum reproductive longevity is about a decade. The gray squirrel is most common in mature contiguous woodlands typically larger than 40 hectares in size, with a diverse woody understory and abundant den cavities (Koprowski 1994).\r\n\r\nMidwest:\r\nIn Illinois, gray squirrels select mature forested stands with closed canopies and well developed understory (Nixon et al. 1978). Brown and Batzli (1984) found that forest patch size was a important factor in gray squirrel distribution. Nixon and Hansen (1987) reported that this species is most common in tracts >40ha along rivers and streams containing at least 20% forested cover and a diverse woody understory. Reige (1991) reported gray squirrel densities in Wisconsin were highest in areas of mature northern red oaks with high mast productivity (Edwards et al. 2003).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nIn California, the Eastern gray squirrel has been introduced to the San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Calaveras, and Stanislaus counties. It inhabits orchards, vineyards and urban/suburban environs and possibly valley foothill riparian habitats. This species seeks cover in dense stands of full canopy trees in which arboreal movement is facilitated. They prefer stands containing large, mast producing trees with abundant cavities and snags, especially near water (Flyger and Gates 1982, Gilroy 1980, Harris et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, gray squirrels use dense live oak hammocks and water oak in cypress-black gum-magnolia swamps bordering streams. Additionally, they inhabit poorly drained bottomlands with pin, evergreen, and overcup oaks, elm, black gum, cypress, ash, and bitter pecan, or well-drained bottomlands containing post oak, red oak, hackberry, and pecan. Upland forest environments are avoided (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mEBSQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB07010", "scientific_name": "Sciurus carolinensis", "ITIS_TSN": "180175", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104371", "common_name": "Eastern Gray Squirrel"}}
