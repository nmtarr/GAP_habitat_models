Ruff. 1999. The Smithsonian book of North American mammals. Washington, DC, Smithsonian Inst. Press. 750 p."}, "habitat_description": "The Greater Bonneted Bat (Eumops perotis) is also called the Western Mastiff Bat.  It is restricted to the more arid regions of the southwestern United States (Cockrum 1960b) and southern Texas (Ammerman et al. 2012).  \r\n\r\nBased on records in the AGFD Heritage Data Management System, the elevation ranges from 240 to 8475 feet (73 - 2583 m; AGFD 2002).  Secret Pass, Mohave County, Arizona is located at 2500 feet elevation (Cockrum 1960b).  \r\n\r\nVaughan (1959) suggests this species selects roost sites located in broken, hilly or mountainous country characterized by steeply sloping terrain.  This species occurs near cliffs, including rugged rocky canyons with abundant crevices (Barbour and Davis 1969).  In Texas, they have been found near the Rio Grande (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Large, exfoliating slabs of rock most often form crevices suitable for roost sites for this species (Vaughan 1959).  Because granitic and consolidated sandstones flake due to weathering and can form deep crevices, E. perotis may be more common where extensive exposures of these rocks occur (Vaughan 1959; Barbour and Davis 1969).  It also selects for rugged rocky canyons and cliffs with crevices for roosts (Barbour and Davis 1969).  \r\n\r\nThis species occurs in the Lower and Upper Sonoran desertscrub (Krutzsch 1943; Barbour and Davis 1969).  Vegetation within the Upper Sonoran Zone include Yucca whipplei, Quercus agrifolia, Adenostoma fasciculatum, and Ceanothus divaricatus (Krutzsch 1943).  \r\n\r\nThe availability of large surfaces of water is required for habitat suitability (Barbour and Davis 1969; Cockrum 1981).  This species uses only select drinking sites and is severely limited by the availability of drinking water (BCI 2002).  Because its wing structure is adapted for fast and straight-line flight, it is unable to drink from water sources less than 30m long (AGFD 2002; BCI 2002).\r\n\r\nE. perotis prefers to feed over large open bodies of water (e.g. ponds, reservoirs, etc.; AGFD 2002) and remains in flight foraging from shortly after dark until early morning -roughly 6.5 hours (Vaughan 1959; Best et al. 1996).  In the Mojave desert, western San Bernardino County, California, this species foraged no less than 15 miles from their roosts (Vaughan 1959).  Vaughan (1959) observed this species foraging from several hundred to 2000 feet above terra firma. Presence of a variety of diurnal insects may indicate it feeds on prey, which has been carried by wind currents to altitudes = 1000 feet (Vaughan 1959).  This species does not appear to have activity peaks during the night, as do many other bats (AGFD 2002).  While foraging, this species does return to its day roost for short periods (~30 minutes; Best et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nThis species tends to roost in high dry places (Freeman 1981; Harvey et al. 1999).  Roost sites are usually in rugged rocky canyons and cliffs with abundant fissures and crevices (Vaughan 1959; Barbour and Davis 1969; Harvey et al. 1999).  Larger crevices with slit-like openings seem to be preferentially selected, which are several feet in length (Vaughan 1959; Barbour and Davis 1969).  Cox (1965) collected bats at two \u201ccrevice roosts;\u201d one was in Greenlee County, the other in Mohave County, Arizona, and both were located at the base of a high cliff.  Roosts are typically high above ground and are characterized by unobstructed approaches (Vaughan 1959; Barbour and Davis 1969).  In Arizona, earlier roosts were associated with human structures, which included signboards, houses, tunnels, and large warehouses (Cockrum 1960b).  Roosts in natural features include crevices, shallow caves and on the sides of cliffs and rock walls (Cockrum 1960b).  It has also been documented using man-made structures, such as buildings (Barbour and Davis 1969) within attics, large warehouse and cracks in masonry walls (Howell 1920).  Colonies are small, usually less than 100 individuals (Barbour and Davis 1969; Harvey et al. 1999).  Because of their large and narrow wings, they have special flight requirements for \u201claunching themselves for takeoff\u201d (Barbour and Davis 1969; Best et al. 1996).  Subsequently, this species selects for roosts, which provide a vertical drop of > 2 meters (Barbour and Davis 1969; Best et al. 1996).  Howell (1920) observed an uninterrupted drop of at least a 20 feet was required for taking flight.  These roosts must be situated to where bats can freefall >2 meters to attain appropriate speeds to launch into flight (Hoffmeister 1986).   These bats tend to wedge themselves in the recesses of narrowing cracks or crevices (AGFD 2002).  It tends to crowd into tight crevices a foot or more deep and two inches or more wide (AGFD 2002).  Colonies may roost even deeper (= 10 feet) within crevices (AGFD 2002).  Many roost sites tend to be occupied periodically rather than year-round (Krutzsch 1955; AGFD 2002).  E. perotis also moves among alternative daytime roosts (Barbour and Davis 1969; Best et al. 1996).  Roosts used for extended periods of time can be determined by large, conspicuous urine stains (Hoffmeister 1986).  Colonies established by this species are usually small < 100 individuals (Best et al. 1996).  Howell (1920) estimates colony size between 20 to 70 individuals.  Both sexes tend to be found together throughout the year (Howell 1920) with adult males occasionally found in maternity colonies (Best et al. 1996).  However, nursery colonies often contain males (Best et al. 1996).  This species does not occupy the same roosts year round (Cockrum 1960b).  They often move around among several roost sites even when they have young (AGFD 2002).  No day roosts have been confirmed in Arizona (Cockrum 1981).  Numerous roosts in fall and winter suggest the dispersal of summer colonies is common, but little is known regarding the extent of movements or whether this species is seasonally migratory (Barbour and Davis 1969).  \r\n\r\nMaternity colonies are believed to be sensitive to disturbance (AGFD 2002).  Mothers with pups may move frequently between several roost sites, which is thought to be influenced by temperature as well as human disturbance (AGFD 2002).  Water diversion and irrigation activities are also believed to adversely impact this species.  This species is no longer found in many previously occupied areas and populations may be in decline (AGFD 2000).  There are several other human activities believed to affect this species.  Grazing and pesticide applications in agricultural areas may impact foraging habitat (AGFD 2002).  Recreational climbing may threaten roost sites (AGFD 2002).  According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, E. perotis is also threatened by urban/suburban expansion and activities that disturb or destroy cliff habitat (e.g. water impoundments, highway construction, quarry operations; AGFD 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGBBAx", "ELCode": "AMACD02010", "scientific_name": "Eumops perotis", "ITIS_TSN": "180080", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103930", "common_name": "Greater Bonneted Bat"}}
