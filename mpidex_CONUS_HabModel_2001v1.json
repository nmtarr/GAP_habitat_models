Such a finding is supported by Hoffman (1955), Harris (1963), and Armstrong (1979).\r\n\r\nPinon deer mice can also be found in: rock outcrops (Quast, 1954; Wilson, 1968; Carraway et al., 1993); bristlecone pine woodlands (Burt, 1934; Deacon et al., 1964); and California coastal chaparral (Marten, 1973; Bradford, 1974).\r\n\r\nWhile some studies have determined that the species avoids higher elevation conifer forests of fir, douglas-fir, spruce, or ponderosa pine (Wilson, 1968), Ribble and Stanley (1998) captured them within open woodland of ponderosa pine in New Mexico. Yang et al. (2011) noted the species\u2019 recent migration to higher elevation woodlands of lodgepole pine and whitebark pine, in the Sierra Nevada.\r\n\r\nP. truei avoids: grasslands (Wilson, 1968; Douglas, 1969); meadows and swales (Quast, 1954; Douglas, 1969); shrublands of rabbitbrush, mountain mahogany, and gray oak (Wilson, 1968); and low elevation desert scrub (Wilson, 1968).\r\n\r\nThe species\u2019 elevation constraints are quite broad, with individuals documented from as low as 183 m (Moritz et al., 2008) to as high as 2896 m (Hoffman, 1955) in California.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPIDEx", "ELCode": "AMAFF03130", "scientific_name": "Peromyscus truei", "ITIS_TSN": "180291", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100548", "common_name": "Pinon Deermouse"}}
