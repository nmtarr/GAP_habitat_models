They inhabit riparian and wet meadows within redwood, fir, and spruce forests as well as alder-salmonberry riparian areas of Douglas fir and redwood systems. Z. trinotatus are less frequently found in lodgepole-pine-salal, Sitka spruce-salal communities, headland prairie and scrub systems. Forested environments tend to be dense, but they will also occupy alpine meadows, and wet grassy areas, riparian-deciduous montane woodlands, and brushy successional stages of redwood, Douglas fir and mixed conifer forests (Wilson and Ruff 1999). In Oregon, Verts and Carraway (1998) summarize habitat as broad leaf maple, red cedar, and alder environments with and understory of salmonberry, red elderberry, devil's club, grasses, sword fern, horsetail, and skunk cabbage (Krutzsch 1954). Gomez (1992) captured pacific jumping mice in shrub-conifer communities and riparian habitats.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPJMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFH01030", "scientific_name": "Zapus trinotatus", "ITIS_TSN": "180388", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100916", "common_name": "Pacific Jumping Mouse"}}
