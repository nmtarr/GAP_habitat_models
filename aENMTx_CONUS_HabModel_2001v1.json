This species can be found along the margins of water bodies, and under logs, boards, leaf litter and abandoned dust piles (Conant and Collins 1998). Also found in ditches (Behler and King 1979). In general, habitat includes bottomland hardwoods, cypress-gum swamps, pine-oak uplands, open woods, live-oak ridges, mixed hardwoods, sandy woodlands, hillsides, pine forests, longleaf pine sandhills, riparian floodplains, coastal secondary dune scrub forest, brackish marshes, and maritime forests (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aENMTx", "ELCode": "AAABE01010", "scientific_name": "Gastrophryne carolinensis", "ITIS_TSN": "173467", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102651", "common_name": "Eastern Narrow-mouthed Toad"}}
