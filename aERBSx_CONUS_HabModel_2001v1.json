It uses damp ground cover or microhabitat situations on the floor of conifer, deciduous or mixed forests (Petranka 1998). Conifer forests are sometimes utilized in the northern parts of this species range (Casper 2005). It avoids seeps, springs or other wet areas (Wilson 1995). Because of their lack of burrowing ability, P. cinereus avoid shallow soils, rocky substrates, and hydric soils (Wyman and Hawksley-Lescault 1987). It goes underground during freezing or hot, dry weather. In New York, it tended to be absent where soil pH was less than 3.8 and was much more abundant in beech forest than in hemlock forest (Wyman 1988, Wyman and Jancola 1992, Frisbie and Wyman 1992). Highest abundances occurs in mature hardwood forests with deep soils and large amounts of decomposing woody debris (Grover 1998, Casper 2005). Pfingsten (1989) considers this species an indicator for mature beech-maple forest in Ohio. Adult males exhibit courtship behavior annually in spring and fall and females apparently breed biennially.  It lays a clutch of up to about 15 eggs in a cavity in log or stump or under rock or other object on ground, mostly in June or July.  The female remains with eggs until hatching in 6-9 weeks (usually August or September) an additional individual (probably male) may occur with attending female (Friet 1995).  The larval stage is passed in the egg.  The female may attend the hatchlings for up to a few weeks after hatching.  Sexual maturity reportedly occurs in about 2-3 years.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aERBSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12020", "scientific_name": "Plethodon cinereus", "ITIS_TSN": "173649", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100626", "common_name": "Eastern Red-backed Salamander"}}
