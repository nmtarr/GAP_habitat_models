Gaps in the range occur in most of northern and central Mexico. The western expansion of this species\u2019 range is the result of multiple introductions (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nThis benthic species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and leaf litter. Nesting sites are located in soft soil or in muskrat houses found in open areas several hundred meters from a permanent water source (Congdon et al. 1987). The habitats occupied by this species include big river drainages, river mouths, tidal areas, low gradient streams, shallow and deep pools of water. Also, herbaceous wetland, forested wetland, scrub-shrub wetland, and temporary pools that occur in riparian zones (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nThis species is found in all types of freshwater habitats. In particular, snapping turtles are found in water bodies characterized by soft, muddy bottoms and abundant aquatic vegetation, or submerged decaying logs. They also occur in some brackish situations. Prolonged periods of inactivity are spend at the bottom of water bodies, but also a substantial amount of time is spent basking in areas nearby water (Brown and Brooks 1994; Herman et al. 1995; Natureserve.org). Hibernation also takes place at the bottom of water bodies, under submerged logs, under vegetation, under overhanging banks, muskrat tunnels/houses, and sometimes even in sites devoid of oxygen (Brown and Brooks 1994; Herman et al. 1995).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSNTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAB01010", "scientific_name": "Chelydra serpentina", "ITIS_TSN": "173752", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103761", "common_name": "Snapping Turtle"}}
