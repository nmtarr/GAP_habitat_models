The authors reported populations to occur more sporadically in the southern and eastern borders of its distribution range.\r\nPopulations found in the mountains of southern California have been recently regarded as members of a distinct Charina species, C. umbratica (Crother 2008; Rodriguez-Robles et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nThe habitats occupied by this species include riparian zones and various terrestrial habitats; conifer forest, grassland, herbaceous, shrubland, chaparral, hardwood and mixed woodlands. This species can be found not far from water in forest clearings, meadows, patchy chaparral, and grassy savannas. Sightings also include sagebrush and riparian zones of arid to semiarid canyons (Brown et al. 1995; Nussbaum et al. 1983; Stebbins 2003; St. John 2002).\r\n\r\nThis is a species that is also found in burrows using soil, or in soil, decaying logs, and leaf litter. It is commonly associated with rocks, rotting logs and stumps, crevices, and fallen bark as cover.\r\n\r\nNW- It is commonly associated with rocks, rotting logs and stumps, crevices, and fallen bark as cover.\r\nSW-Grassy savannas, meadows, and patchy chaparral.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rNRBOx", "ELCode": "ARADA01010", "scientific_name": "Charina bottae", "ITIS_TSN": "174326", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100271", "common_name": "Northern Rubber Boa"}}
