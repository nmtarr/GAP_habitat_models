The meadow jumping mouse is found in moist lowland habitats; it prefers relatively thick vegetation of open grassy and brushy areas of marshes, meadows, swamps, and streamsides (Natureserve). Although most often seen in meadows, jumping mice may also be encountered in vegetation along creeks, at the edges of woods, and occasionally in woodlands having a lush carpet of grasses, sedges and herbs. Moist sites in bogs and fens and along streams as well as dry upland sites are all suitable as habitat, provided dense herbaceous vegetation is present.\r\n\r\nBoth day-nests and hibernacula can be located up to at least 175m away from standing water (Bain and Shenk 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMJMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFH01010", "scientific_name": "Zapus hudsonius", "ITIS_TSN": "180386", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105207", "common_name": "Meadow Jumping Mouse"}}
