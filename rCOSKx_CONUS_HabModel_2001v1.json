This species generally occurs in humid wooded areas where refuge in the form of leaf litter and loose rocks is provided. Surprisingly, it also occurs in disturbed areas such as highways, clearcuts and powerline corridors (Hulse et al. 2001). \r\n\r\nThe habitats occupied by this species include forested wetland, riparian zones, scrub-shrub wetland, conifer forest, hardwood forest, and various woodlands. It has been reported that this species is associated with springs, swamps, and bogs, but is also found on dry, rocky, south-facing hillsides (Johnson 2000; Hulse et al. 2001). Individuals have also been reported to take refuge under logs and rocks in the vicinity of water, but also in water (Mount 1975).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Riparian zones, hardwood forest, and various woodlands.\r\nGP\t-Conifer forest, springs, hills, scrubland, and shrubland.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rCOSKx", "ELCode": "ARACH01010", "scientific_name": "Plestiodon anthracinus", "ITIS_TSN": "208882", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101505", "common_name": "Coal Skink"}}
