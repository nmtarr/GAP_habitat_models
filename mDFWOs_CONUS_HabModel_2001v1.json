Most of the historic habitat and flood refugia have been converted to cultivated fields, orchards, and vineyards (Williams and Basey 1986); clearing of vegetation for levee maintenance also has diminished habitat. Status of a population that existed in the early 1970s near the type locality at Vernalis is unknown (USFWS 2000). Current taxonomy is still based on Hooper (1938) and genetic analyses have not been performed (USFWS 1998). Habitat includes evergreen or live oak, deciduous valley oaks, and various thick-leaved trees and shrubs (Kelly 1990, Williams et al. 1992). They are most abundant where shrubs are densest - providing cover - and avoid open areas. Willow thickets with an oak overstory often contain the highest densities of individuals and their stick houses (Linsdale and Tevis 1951).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mDFWOs", "ELCode": "AMAFF08081", "scientific_name": "Neotoma fuscipes riparia", "ITIS_TSN": "180373", "Global_SEQ_ID": "768539", "common_name": "San Joaquin Valley Wood Rat"}}
