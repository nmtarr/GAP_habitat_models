At lower elevations individuals are often abundant in or about seeps, or along margins of small streams with rocks, logs, mosses, and other cover.  In mountainous regions, D. fuscus are often found several meters from the waters edge.  D. fuscus is generally rare above 1200m in elevation with the exception of areas in and around Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Petranka 1998).  Courtship may occur both in fall and spring. Oviposition peaks in July in many areas. Clutch size often 10-30. Eggs attended by female. Larvae hatch in 5-9 weeks (Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio) or 10-13 weeks (Ohio), metamorphose 6-13 months later (in June or July in Ohio). Sexually mature in 2-3 years.  The larval stage is aquatic.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aNDSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03040", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus fuscus", "ITIS_TSN": "173633", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104045", "common_name": "Northern Dusky Salamander"}}
