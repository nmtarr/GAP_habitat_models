It is not found west of the Green River.  Little was known about this species\u2019 habitat or distribution until the work described by Keinath et al. (2014).  The region occupied by this species is dominated by Big sagebrush steppe communities, while other community types with plants like Gardner saltbush (Atriplex gardneri), yellow rabbitbrush, winterfat, and greasewood are interspersed within it.  Wyoming Pocket Gophers are more habitat specialist than Northern Pocket Gophers, and prefer areas with more bare ground, fewer surface rocks, less litter cover, less big sagebrush cover, less yellow rabbitbrush cover, greater Gardner\u2019s saltbush cover, and greater winterfat cover (Keinath et al. 2014).   However, the presence of Gardner\u2019s saltbush was the most definitive element of Wyoming Pocket Gopher habitat: they occurred in locations where Gardner\u2019s saltbush grew, and Northern Pocket Gophers occurred in areas where it did not (Keinath et al. 2014).  T. clusius was negatively associated with sagebrush (Artemesia sp.). N.
