The habitat includes cropland, forest edge, herbaceous areas, grassland, conifer woodland, and suburban areas. In particular, this species occurs in rocky hillsides of dry open woods, woodland edge, heavily wooded bottomlands, pine flatwoods, pastures, limestone and sandstone cedar glades, dry and mesic hammocks, swamp borders and margins of streams of arid areas. Found often in gardens, orchards, vacant lots, and other suburban areas (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Mitchell 1994; Palmer and Braswell 1995; Trauth et al. 2004).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Found in vegetated areas composed of conifer woodland, forest edge, gardens, and orchards.
