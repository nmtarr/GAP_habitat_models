It is also common in coastal (marine) harbors, jetties, etc. foraging over nearby waters and marshes (De Jong 1996) and occurs in woodlands (DeGraaf et al. 1991). \r\n\r\nRough-winged Swallows forage over water or fields and along narrow gullies and other irregular terrain (De Jong 1996), and their local distributions depend on the distributions of nesting microhabitats (De Jong 1996).  Nests are placed inside burrows located in precipitous banks of clay, sand, or gravel, but any cavity or crevice in a vertical surface, including gutters, culverts, drainpipes, boxes, and crevices or holes in walls, wharves, bridges, boats, ships, and semitrailers, could be used (De Jong 1996).  Most nests are located near rocky gorges, shale banks, stony road cuts, railroad embankments, eroded stream margins, and other such exposed banks of clay, sand, or gravel.  Although nest sites are usually associated with water of some sort, this is likely due to a correlation between water and suitable nesting substrates.  In the western U.S., dry arroyos provide adequate nesting sites and airspace for feeding (De Jong 1996).\r\n\r\nIn the West, Rough-winged Swallows are often found around gravel pits, stream banks, and other exposed banks of sand, dirt or gravel (DeGraaf et al. 1991).  Areas of open water, mudflats and sites containing extensive vegetative cover are utilized most often in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Throughout Utah, they reside in lower valleys during summer, nesting colonies are often found in earthen banks along stream banks (UDWR 2003).  Throughout the Sonoran Zones of Arizona, they are common nesters at earthen banks of streams, but they occur irregularly in Flagstaff (Phillips et al. 1964).  In Colorado, they breed locally in sandbanks and occur widely over riparian and agricultural areas during migration (Andrews and Righter 1991). \r\n\r\nDe Jong (1996) reported nests to be below 2,000 m in the U.S, but the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (2002) reported nesting between 910 and 2,130 m and Kingery (1998) reported breeding in Colorado at elevations up to 2,988 m. \r\n\r\nLittle information is available on the wintering habitat of the Rough-winged Swallow, but it is known to inhabit lowlands and foothills along river channels, agricultural fields, marshes, lakes, and rivers in Florida and Central America (De Jong 1996).\r\n\r\nN.
