Individuals can be observed in marshes, wetlands along the edges of large rivers, beaver ponds, sloughs with rotting logs, drainage ditches, swampy weedy lake margins, oxbow lakes, floodplains, and brackish tidal areas (Dundee and Rossman 1989; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Trauth et al. 2004; Werler and Dixon 2000). Burrows are usually found in fallen logs, leaf litter, soft soil, wet mats of vegetation along the edges of water bodies. The eggs are laid in an underground cavity, sometimes in alligator nests.\r\n\r\nThis snake occupies areas that are heavily vegetated and moist. It occurs in herbaceous, shrub-scrub and forested wetlands.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rRBMUx", "ELCode": "ARADB14010", "scientific_name": "Farancia abacura", "ITIS_TSN": "174164", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106573", "common_name": "Red-bellied Mudsnake"}}
