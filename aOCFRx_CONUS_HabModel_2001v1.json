Breeding occurs in flooded pastures, roadside ditches, and shallow ponds; Bodies of water where they occur are characterized by low vegetation density (Behler and King 1979).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aOCFRx", "ELCode": "AAABC05050", "scientific_name": "Pseudacris ornata", "ITIS_TSN": "173531", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105957", "common_name": "Ornate Chorus Frog"}}
