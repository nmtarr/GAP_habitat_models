Also, found in grassland, old fields, savanna, shrubland, chaparral, orchards, and various woodland ecosystems. This species is known to burrow in or using soil, leaf litter, and fallen logs, while hibernation occurs sometimes in abandoned ant mounds. It is commonly found in meadows, moist grassy fields, stream borders, bogs, open moist woodland, grassy marshes, and abandoned fields (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nSW-\tFound in grassland, shrubland, and woodland associations.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSMGRx", "ELCode": "ARADB47010", "scientific_name": "Opheodrys vernalis", "ITIS_TSN": "174173", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103123", "common_name": "Smooth Greensnake"}}
