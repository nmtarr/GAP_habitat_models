Uses riparian areas, open woodlands, chaparral, mountain meadows, and other habitats rich in nectar-producing flowers, including gardens and orchards. During winter in central Mexico, uses oak forests with pines and junipers interspersed (2,300\u20133,000 m). Higher in fir forests if mixed with oaks; shrubby habitats in secondary succession (vegetation types: see Rzedowski 1981)(quoted directly from Healy and Calder 2006).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nFor Nevada, riparian and wet meadow were idenitfied as important to this species. These vegetation types were not identified as important throughout the remainder of the Southwest. Thus, either this species selects for these systems in Nevada only, or these types were\r\noverlooked in other areas. It is likely these vegetation types are important to this species as stopover habitat throughout out the project area; however, we found no information to support this. Woodlands through Mixed Conifer: In the Chiricahua Mountains, it is \u201cregular\u201d\r\nfrom woodlands through coniferous forest from mid-July onward (Ligon and Balda 1968). These primary woodland types expected to occur in the Chiricahua Mountains. Because Ligon and Balda (1968) identified \u201cwoodlands\u201d within the Chiricahuas, and it seems reasonable they were referring to the primarily woodland types, inclusion of these systems seem reasonable. This species is expected to \u201cstop-over\u201d on its migration southward back to Latin America within these ecological systems. While all of the conifer ecological systems are known to occur within Arizona; however, the last three systems are not specific as to whether they occur in southern Arizona. Because Ligon and Balda (1968) identified \u201cmixed conifer forests\u201d within the Chiricahuas, and these ecological systems may occur with southern Arizona, inclusion of this system is reasonable. This species is expected to \u201cstop-over\u201d on its migration southward back to Latin America within this ecological system.\r\nIn California, trees and shrubs in many habitats provide cover, including lowland riparian, open \r\nwoodlands, scrub, and chaparral, also mountain meadows extending to and above treeline \r\n(Grinnell and Miller 1944). Breeding areas north of California in coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1983); nest variously placed in berry tangles, shrubs, and conifers.\r\nArizona elevation is from 1727 to 2727 meters (Swarth 1904; Ben\u00e9 1947; Kodric-Brown and Brown 1978). Colorado elevation is from 2121 an 3030 meters (Cooke 1897). Elevational range in New Mexico is from 1515 to 3818 meters (Bailey 1928; Heinemann 1992). While in the Huachuca Mountains, this species occurs between 8000 to 9000 feet (2424-2727 meters) elevation (Swarth 1904), while Ben\u00e9 (1946) identified this species at 5700 feet (1727 meters) elevation. In the White Mountains, Arizona, Kodric-Brown and Brown (1978) conducted investigations on territoriality within a meadow at 2300 meters elevation. For Arizona, we have information from three sources representing two different areas. These areas occur within two different latitudinal quadrants.  Consequently, this information satisfies EDR 5. Therefore, the estimated elevational range for Arizona is from 1727 to 2727 meters. For Nevada, elevational range is from 1242 to 2197 meters (Linsdale 1936; Gullion et al. 1959; Ligon 1936). Historically in southwestern Colorado, this species breeds from 7000 to 10000 feet (2121 \u2013 3030 meters) and ranges in the summer several thousand feet higher (Cooke 1897). The elevational range provided for this species is based on \u201cbreeding records?\u201d This information is over 100 years old and it conflicts with our current knowledge of this species breeding habits within Colorado. Also, there is no information to support this species was actually observed breeding or nesting within southwestern Colorado. However, this information may be used to suggest the elevational range for stopover habitat. This elevational range for the southwestern extent of the state is between 2121 an 3030 meters. In New Mexico, this species is \u201ccommon\u201d from 5000 to 12600 feet (1515-3818) elevation (Bailey 1928). In the Sandia Mountains, New Mexico, it was observed in established feeding territories comprised of Scrophularia spp. flower between 2000 to 3000 meters (Heinemann 1992). For New Mexico, statewide and site-specific information was available. Because the information for the Sandia Mountains falls within the state elevational range, the state elevational range is used, which is between 1515 to 3818 meters. For Nevada, elevation information is based on three individual observations; these range in elevation from 7000 to 7250 feet (2121-2197 meters; Linsdale 1936). Also, Gullion et al. (1959) provide an elevational range from 4100 to 5500 feet (1242 \u2013 1667 meters) elevation; this was based on five observations within southern Nevada.  The elevational information provided by Ligon (1936) and Gullion et al. (1959) was based on a paucity of observations \u2013 n = 3 and n = 5, respectively. However, this information agrees well with the information for Arizona and New Mexico. Therefore, this information will not be excluded due to a dearth of data. Elevational range is combined using EDR 3, which is from 1242 to 2197 meters. The elevational information for Utah is based on one observation. Therefore, it will not be used as an indicator for elevation for the entire state. However, this one observation does fall within the elevational range for AZ, NM and NV.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bRUHUx", "ELCode": "ABNUC51020", "scientific_name": "Selasphorus rufus", "ITIS_TSN": "178040", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102866", "common_name": "Rufous Hummingbird"}}
