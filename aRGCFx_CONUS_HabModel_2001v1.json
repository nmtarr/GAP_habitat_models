Considered native to the lower Rio Grande Valley in Cameron and Hidalgo Counties, but have been introduced via sales of potted plants into Dallas, Houston, Corpus Christi, Tyler, San Antonio, Huntsville, LaGrange, and Kingsville (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nAbundantly distributed in the lower Rio Grande Valley even in urban areas; this frog can be found in irrigated lawns and flower beds at night and even in gutters and ditches. Hides during the day in humid shelter. Its natural habitat includes environs of palm groves, ditches, resacas, and thickets (Conant and Collins 1998). Occurs also in cultivated agricultural areas, under rocks, grasslands, and any other moist environment (Behler and King 1979).\r\nWhile most documented sightings are from urban environments, this species also occupies low elevation coastal plains in the Tamaulipan Province. Other natural settings include riparian zones, borders of lotic and temporary to semi-permanent waters (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRGCFx", "ELCode": "AAABD04210", "scientific_name": "Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides", "ITIS_TSN": "550238", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103536", "common_name": "Rio Grande Chirping Frog"}}
