They also occur in damp shaded ravines. They are most often observed under damp leaf mold on the forest floor and under moss mats, logs or other objects in the vicinity of springs, seepages or small streams (Martof et al. 1980, Petranka 1998). D. aeneus shuns sunny areas.  They are completely terrestrial with no aquatic larval stage.  Likely to be vulnerable to intensive management practices that eliminate leaf litter and shading, such as clear-cutting. They are restricted to elevations of 30-1340 m. Eggs usually laid April-June, though late winter and spring in western Alabama. Female stays with clutch of 5-17 eggs 5-7 weeks until hatching. May be 2 annual nesting periods in some areas. Mature in 2 years. Eggs are laid under moss or in small, protected depressions.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSEESx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03010", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus aeneus", "ITIS_TSN": "173636", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100247", "common_name": "Seepage Salamander"}}
