Observations indicate that these horses utilize multiple habitat types, all characterized by the presence of grass for grazing. Other populations of free-roaming individuals occur in Maryland/Virginia on Assateague Island; in North Carolina at the northernmost reaches of the Currituck Banks north of Corolla; and on Shackleford Banks and adjacent small islands near Cape Lookout. Horses on Ocracoke Island, NC (manged by the National Park Service) are no longer free-roaming and have been kept in enclosures since 1959.\r\n\r\nGreat Plains/Southwest/Northwest:\r\nIn the western US (OR, ID, MT, WY, CO, NM, AZ, UT, NV, and CA), feral horses are mostly managed by the Bureau of Land Management in units designated as herd management areas (HMAs). These delineated regions are subsets of herd areas believed to contain populations at the time of enactment of the Wild and Free-roaming Horse and Burro Act of 1971. The BLM estimated the population within it's management areas to be approximately 58,150 as of March 2015. In addtion to BLM designated HMAs, populations of these equids also exist on Native American lands incuding Navajo territories in Arizona and New Mexico, Apache lands in New Mexico, rangelands of the Warm Springs Confederated Tribes in central Oregon, and the Yakima Nation in central Wasthington. In the West, this species breeds in shrubby sagebrush plains and mountains, juniper woodland; ranges include grazing area, shelter, water, and shade (Slade and Godfrey 1982, Miller 1983). In California, this species is found in open stages of a variety of habitats, particularly those of the Great Basin. Perennial grasslands, wet meadows, pastures, pinyon-juniper, Joshua tree, and desert scrub are preferred habitats in the Owens Valley. Riparian\r\nhabitats are used, as well as open stages of other hardwood and hardwood-conifer areas. Sagebrush habitats also used (quoted directly from [Hopkins et al. for CAWHR 2008] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mHORSx", "ELCode": "AMATA01010", "scientific_name": "Equus caballus", "ITIS_TSN": "180691", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103569", "common_name": "Horse"}}
