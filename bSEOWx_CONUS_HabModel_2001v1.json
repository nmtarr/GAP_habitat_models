It forages within nesting habitat but it also forages more widely in systems that have a greater shrub component or in areas that are more developed (Holt and Leasure 1993).  Usually it roosts on the ground but may roost in trees if present, especially if ground is snow-covered or moist (Banfield 1947; Bosakowski 1986; Walk 1998).  It apparently forages widely in semi-deserts of northern Utah (Behle et al. 1985) but usually it is not found in the very dry deserts (Davis 1997); one winter record exists from the extreme desert of Arizona (Monson and Phillips 1981).  In Nevada, this species forages in uplands but usually there is a grassy component in the understory (Neel, pers. Comm., 2005).  This species is highly nomadic and often forages widely over upland landcover types that are not used for nesting.  Within the Southwest, the short-eared owl occurs in:\r\n- Grassy areas, including montane grasslands; short-grass prairies; tall grass sedge; disturbed areas with mixed native, non-native grasses, or non-native perennials; and other native perennial grasslands throughout the SWReGAP region (Ligon 1961; Alcorn 1988; Hooper and Pitt 1996; Boyle 1998; Lehman et al. 1998; Lehman, pers. Comm., 2004).\r\n- Shrub-steppe where grasses are mixed with big sagebrush (Artemisia  tridentata), shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), or crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) (Reynolds 1983; Lehman et al. 1998).\r\n- Emergent fresh or salt water marsh/wetlands (with salt grass, cattails, sedges, rushes, or bulrushes) (Hayward et al. 1976; Behle 1981; Behle et al. 1985; Alcorn 1988; Boyle 1998).  \r\n- Wet meadows, pastures, weedy fields, and irrigated agriculture (cultivated and harvested) (Hayward et al. 1976; Linner 1980; Behle 1981; Behle et al. 1985; Alcorn 1988).\r\n- Grassy developed areas such as airport fields (Linner 1980; Johnsgard 1988; Holt and Leasure 1993), reclaimed strip mines (Machniak and Feldhamer 1993; Ingold 2002), golf courses (Banfield 1947), and rural farms and shelter belts (Boyle 1988). It has been documented using roadside and irrigation ditches (Lein and Boxall 1979; Stone et al. 1994).\r\n- May use riparian strips within open areas and with vegetation such as tall grass, willows and/or cottonwoods (Bailey and Niedrach 1965; Stone et al. 1994; Neel, pers. Comm., 2005).\r\n- Less often found in shrublands such as sagebrush, tall desert shrub (saltbush, shadscale, black greasewood, blackbrush), and in Colorado it was very rarely found in scrub oak or pinyon/juniper types (Boyle 1998).  In east central NV it was occasionally seen during breeding season in shadescale community with shadescale (Atriplex confertifolia), green molly (Kochia Americana), common winterfat (Eurotia lanata), bud sagebrush (Artemisia spinescens), spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa) (Medin 1990).  In winter in southeast New Mexico the species has historically been documented using chaparral (Condalia) and other thickets of brush (oak, cedar) of foothills and canyons where grasses are overgrown by shrubs (Bailey 1928; Ligon 1961).  \r\n\r\nThe only information on elevation range from the Southwest is from Andrews and Righter (1992) who report it generally occurs up to 2,530 m in Colorado with one record from 3,048 m, but do not report a lower limit. It occurs down to sea level on both coasts of North America (Holt and Leasure 1993). \r\n\r\nThere is some evidence that this species is area sensitive.  Shaw (1995) found that sites in Scotland needed to be at least 60-100 ha in size to support a pair of owls. However, we could find no other literature to support this and Shaw (1995) cautions that defining a minimum territory size may be unwise given temporal and spatial variation in prey numbers; therefore, we did not use a patch size in the model. \r\n\r\nThis species may be declining (Holt and Leasure 1993).  In Colorado, it seems to be declining, especially along the Front Range, because the Colorado Breeding Bird Atlas (Boyle 1998) did not find it in locations previously reported as breeding areas by Bailey and Niedrach (1965); also may be declining along the Wasatch Front of Utah (Behle et al. 1985).  Declines may be related to more intensive agricultural practices and urbanization, especially through the planting of trees in natively treeless regions (Boyle 1998); however, this bird seems to be absent from much suitable habitat in North America so there may be other important factors, such as predation by species associated with human settelement (Boyle 1998).\r\n\r\nBreeding range is associated with large expanses of grassy open areas with rodent populations (Holt and Leasure 1993).  In Nevada, nesting only occurs in wet meadows, emergent wetlands, or other areas with a heavy grass understory (Neel, pers. Comm., 2005).  In Colorado, nests were found in montane grasslands, marshes, and in a rural shelterbelt, and more than 2/3 of occurrences during the breeding season were in grasslands, prairies, and wetlands (Boyle 1998).  In Utah, this owl nests in marshes, irrigated, non-woody agricultural areas (alfalfa or wet pasture), and arid grasslands (Behle 1981; Walters and Sorensen 1983).  In southwestern Idaho, 65% of nests were on disturbed grasslands with native perennial grasses and non-native annual grasses (Lehman et al. 1998; Lehman, pers. Comm., 2004).\r\n\r\nThis owl nests on the ground, often on small ridges or raised areas or on drier upland areas within wetlands (Holt and Leasure 1993).  Nests are in low in moderately dense vegetation (30-60cm \u2013 Duebbert and Lokemoen 1977; less than 50 cm-- Herkert et al. 1999) but it also needs a dense leaf litter layer and some cover such as beneath shrubs or grass clumps (Boyle 1998).  Mowing and burning vegetation is likely beneficial over the long term (Herkert et al. 1999), however nests are destroyed by agricultural machinery used to harvest crops.   \u2013SWreGAP notes edited by N.
