They are uncommon summer residents in the Mogollan Mountains of New Mexico (Hubbard 1965).  In Rio Arriba County in New Mexico, they are common summer residents believed to possibly nest near cliffs in pinyon-juniper-oak woodland (Stahlecker et al., 1998).\r\n\r\nWhite-throated Swifts live in primarily mountainous country, especially near cliffs and canyons where breeding occurs; they will occasionally nest in buildings.  Nests are placed in crevices in cliffs, canyon walls, pinnacles, and large rocks; and in a variety of human-made structures such as freeway overpasses, bridges, highway cuts, quarries, tile roofs and crevices in buildings and stadiums (Bent 1961, Ryan and Collins 2000).  \r\n\r\nSuitable cliffs include those surrounded by open, grassy or desert habitats as well as coniferous and deciduous forests and shrublands (AOU, 1983).  In Washington, they nest at cliffs within the ponderosa zone as well as shrub-steppe and grasslands at lower elevations (Ryan and Collins 2000).  On the Pacific Coast, they nest on coastal hill, bluffs, and rocky islands (Ryan and Collins 2000).\r\n\r\nAlthough they only breed at suitable cliffs or other structures, they range widely while foraging (Ryan and Collins 2000). \r\n\r\nElevation ranges reported by Ryan and Collins (2000) are: between 1,700 and 2,500 m in Colorado, between 300 and 800 m in British Columbia, up to 3,369 m in California, and up to 2,000 m in Baja California (Ryan and Collins 2000).  However, they tend to range widely in search of food and can be found at higher and lower elevations than the listed ones (Johnsgard, 1979).  Alderfer (2006) reported a maximum breeding elevation of 3,962 m.  \r\n\r\nDuring winter, White-throated Swifts move to milder climates at lower latitudes and elevations (Ryan and Collins 2000).  N.
