Also. South of the Mississippi River basin through Louisiana and eastern Kansas. Disjunct populations are found in central Kansas, Oklahoma (Lake Texoma), Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky (Natureserve.org; Vogt 1981). Subspecies Sabinensis occupies the Sabine drainage of Louisiana and Texas (Ernst et al. 1994; Vogt 1993; Vogt 1995).\r\n\r\nThis species is described as a benthic species known to burrow in or using soil. Primary habitats include big rivers, creeks, and low gradient streams. Also, temporary pools and other riparian situations. Not very common, but also found on sand dunes (Natureserve.org). Nesting occurs in beaches and sandbars within 100 meters of permanent water sources (Vogt 1981). Hibernation sites may be under rocks, wing dams, or underwater (Natureserve.org; Vogt 1981).\r\n\r\nIn Kansas, this species is reported to be abundant in rivers characterized by submerged aquatic vegetation (Fuselier and Edds 1994).\r\n\r\nNot any specific cover species, but implied to have strong relationships with dense vegetation found in riparian zones.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rOMTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAD05110", "scientific_name": "Graptemys ouachitensis", "ITIS_TSN": "173799", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102685", "common_name": "Ouachita Map Turtle"}}
