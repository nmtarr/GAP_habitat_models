However, the species has adapted well to manmade structures and now uses both types of shelter, arboreal and manmade, as roosts and nurseries (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Roosts and nurseries have been found in hollow trees, old and abandoned buildings, house attics, barns, bridges, water culverts and other places that provide dark, secluded 'nooks and crannies' (Webster et al. 1985, Brown 1997).  Evening bats, prefer deciduous and mixed forest interspersed with cultivated areas (NatureServe 2005), and are also know to roost under bark of dead snags in beaver ponds and in cavities of longleaf pine in the Upper Coastal Plain (Menzel et al 2001).  They use many species of trees including longleaf pine, loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, bald cypress, red maple, oaks, and mesquite (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Menzel et al. (2001) did not find roosts in loblolly pines.  They do not exclusively use large trees and will even use understory trees as roosts.  They forage in riparian areas, beaver ponds, marshes, corn and cotton fields, bays, farm ponds, along large streams, forest openings, over clearings, above forest canopies, and among canopy gaps (Menzel et al. 2001, GA-GAP 2003, Ammerman et al. 2012). Evening bats may swarm around mouths of caves and mines in fall but do not commonly inhabit them (NatureServe 2005,Watkins 1972).   \r\n\r\nWatkins (1972) stated that the species is found up to 300 m or more.
