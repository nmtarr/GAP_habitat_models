While this range includes extensive data on population occurrences, the range along the Appalachian Mountains remains poorly defined.\r\n\r\nThis species burrows in or using soil, fallen logs, vegetative debris, hollow trees, and standing snag. This species hibernates in deep crevices, or underground. The variety of habitats where this species occurs include forested wetland and riparian zones, bare rock, talus, scree, cliffs, hedgerow, cropland, hardwood forest, conifer forest, old field, savanna, suburban, orchards, and various woodland types (Natureserve.org). This species can be found in particular features within its range such as: wooded canyons, wooded areas of streams and rivers, farmland near woodland, old fields, barnyards, rural buildings, and rocky timbered upland. It has been commonly reported in areas where open and wooded habitats are connected. \r\n\r\nNE\t-Hedgerow, cropland, suburban, conifer and hardwood forest.\r\nSE-\tFarmland and suburban areas, various woodland types, and forested wetlands.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rGRRAx", "ELCode": "ARADB13090", "scientific_name": "Pantherophis spiloides", "ITIS_TSN": "209215", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101345", "common_name": "Gray Ratsnake"}}
