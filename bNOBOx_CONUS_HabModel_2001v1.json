In 1985, it was reintroduced in Buenos Aries Wildlife Refuge in the Alter Valley in southern Arizona (Arizona Game and Fish Department 2001). \r\n\r\nThe Bobwhite is associated with a variety of early-successional stage habitats, such as what exists in agricultural areas, brushy pastures, grassy roadsides, grasslands, open park-like mixed deciduous and pine woodlands and savannas, grass-brush rangelands (Brennan 1999), overgrown fields, native prairies, woodland edges (Fussell 1994), and gaps made in the forest by logging (Stupka 1963).  In Tennessee, they are most abundant in a mosaic of agricultural fields, wooded hedgerows, and fallow fields dominated by broom sedge (Nicholson 1997).  In the Upper Coastal Plains of Georgia, White et al. (2005) located nests in fallow fields, open-canopy planted pine stands, young pine plantations, and pine-plantations that were >7 yr old and had been row-thinned.  None were found in hardwood stands >5 yrs old.  All of the nests that they found in closed-canopy pine stands were <25 m from the stand\u2019s edge.  Guthery et al. (2001) examined Bobwhite habitat in an Oklahoma landscape and found brushy prairie and early-successional woodlands to be beneficial while mature woodlands were detrimental to Bobwhite populations.\r\n\r\nIn general, Bobwhite habitat is characterized by an open canopy or grassland with the presence of grasses, forbs, shrubs, and intermittent small patches of bare ground among stems and clumps of herbaceous vegetation (Brennan 1999, White et al. 2005).  Their abundance and nest site selection are influenced at the landscape scale by landscape composition (percent of landcover types) and landscape configuration (patch diversity; White et al. 2005).  The landscapes historically created by agriculture, a patchwork of croplands, fallow fields, hardwood forests, and pine plantations, were beneficial to the Bobwhite because of its preference for early-successional habitats and ecotones (Brennan 1999, Gutherey et al. 2001, White et al. 2005).  Modern agriculture has trended towards larger, \u201ccleaner\u201d fields without these features, which has been implicated in large scale population declines (Brennan 1999).  Although the agricultural landscapes that preceded intensive farming methods were beneficial to Bobwhites, they were not required; natural habitat types alone can host high densities of Bobwhites (Guthery et al. 2001).  \r\n\r\nWithin woodlands, Bobwhites utilize early successional conditions that are created by disturbance events such as fires, logging, and agriculture (Brennan 1999). In southern pine forests, frequent (1-3 yr intervals) fires are necessary to maintain the open conditions needed by Bobwhites (Brennan 1999).  They are commonly found in pine woodlands with well developed grass ground cover and little or no midstory, such as longleaf-slash, loblolly-shortleaf in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and Piedmont and virginia pine, shortleaf pine in the Ridge and Valley, Highland Rim, Cumberland Plateau and Peidmont (Hunter 1990).  Bobwhite are typically absent from high-density pine plantations (Brennan 1999).  Well-drained upland pine and mixed deciduous woodlands with <50% canopy cover offer the \u201cbest opportunities for bobwhite management\u201d (Brennan 1999). \r\n\r\nBobwhite also exist in rangelands landscapes that are not dominated by forests or woodlands.  Some strong Bobwhite populations occur in north Texas, south Texas, and Oklahoma in rangeland habitats where agriculture is absent (Guthery et al. 2001).  They are also found in Cross Timbers forests, tallgrass prairies, sandsage-grasslands, and brushy prairies (Guthery et al. 2001).  Open grasslands in the West can be suitable if they are mixed with small shrubs, thorny bushes, or trees (Brennan 1999).  In rangelands, they exist in early and late successional stage habitats and they benefit from light cattle grazing (Brennan 1999).  Brushy draws, fencerows, and woodlots are also used in the Midwest and Great Plains. \r\n\r\nBobwhites place nests in woodlands or fields (Harrison 1975), usually within 15-20 m of an opening such as a field or road.  The nest is located on ground that is partially covered with standing vegetation <45 cm tall (Brennan 1999) and placed in a tuft of dead or living grass with surrounding herbaceous plants covering it and often woven into an arch above it (Harrison 1975).  After their eggs hatch, the parents lead the fledgling to habitat that is more open than where nest was placed.  These brood habitats can be over 500 m from the nest.\r\n\r\nThe elevation range within which Bobwhite are found in New Mexico and Arizona is 942-1,830m (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2001). \r\n\r\nN.
