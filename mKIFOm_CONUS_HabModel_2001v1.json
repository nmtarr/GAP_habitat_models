The southern part of the valley was typified by the alkali sink and alkali flat habitat types, with dominant plant species including Atriplex polycarpa (saltbush), Allenrolfea occidentalis (iodine bush), Amaranthus albus (tumbleweed), Frankenia grandifolia (alkali heath), and Salicornia subterminalis (pickleweed) widely spaced. Areas in which iodine bush was predominant were known to be poorly drained areas that did not support kangaroo rats and were not apparently utilized by the kit fox (Jensen 1972). Areas near Bakersfield with plant associations dominated by Prosopis juliflora (honey mesquite) and Atriplex lentiformis (quail bush) were observed to support large numbers of Beechey ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi) to the detriment of kangaroo rat abundance, and such areas were observed to support kit fox at lower densities than the saltbush habitat (Jensen 1972). In most other areas of the valley and surrounding lower foothills, kit fox were found in California annual grassland habitat typified by Bromus spp.(brome grass), Festuca spp. (fescue), Avena fatua (wild oats), Hordeum spp. (barley), and Erodium (filaree) (Jensen 1972). Finally, kit fox were observed in several areas that were dry farmed, including an area east of San Lucas in Monterey County and the Shandon-Cholame area in San Luis Obispo County.\" (quoted directly from USFWS 2010).\r\n\r\nCurrent habitat includes natural and annual grasslands and scrublands, vernal pools, alkali meadows and playas, valley sink scrub, saltbush scrub, interior coast range saltbush scrub, upper Sonoran scrub, valley oak woodlands, and occassionally grazed, nonirrigated grasslands, orchards and vineyards for foraging (USFWS 1998, Bell 1994, Hall 1983, Morrell 1971, O\u2019Farrell 1980). For denning, this species prefers loose-textured, deep soils and avoids shallow, hardpan soils with high water tables (USFWS 1998, Grinnell et al. 1937, Hall 1946, Egoscue 1962, Morrell 1972, O\u2019Farrell and Gilbertson 1979, O\u2019Farrell et al. 1980, McCue et al. 1981, Morrell 1972). Topography is an important aspect of habitat, particularly for den sites. Optimal slopes are those less than 5 percent, while slopes between 5 and 15 percent are suitable. Briden et al. (1992) found that half of all dens surveyed were located on slopes of 20 degrees or less, while 92 percent of all dens located were on slopes of less than 30 percent. In addition, 98 percent of dens were found below 1,100 feet elevation (Cypher 2006, USFWS 2010). This species has been shown to actively avoid agricultural lands (Jensen 1972, Warrick et al. 2007). Development of oilfields and supporting infrastucture (roads, pipelines, sumps, etc...) are preferential to kit fox predators such as coyotes and therefore have negative effects on surviorship and abundance for this subspecies (Cypher et al. 2000, USFWS 2010). A stable population exists within the suburban environments of Bakersfield, CA. Additionally, they occur in other urban areas including Taft, Tulare, Visalia, and Porterville (USFWS 1998, Frost 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mKIFOm", "ELCode": "AMAJA03041", "scientific_name": "Vulpes macrotis mutica", "ITIS_TSN": "180606", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101320", "common_name": "Kit Fox - San Joaquin Valley Population"}}
