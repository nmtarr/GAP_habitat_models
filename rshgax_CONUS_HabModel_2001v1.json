In New York, populations are found in Chatagua, Allegheny, and Cattaraugus counties while introduced populations are found on isolated on drainages found in Chemung County (Bothner 1986).\r\nIntroductions include portions of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and Ohio (Conant and Collins 1991; Lethaby 2004 (As referenced by Natureserve.org); Novotny 1990 (As referenced by Natureserve.org)).\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil, leaf litter, and fallen logs. Individuals can be observed basking on the ground or in stone piles during the daytime. Hibernation often takes place underground on steep rocky slopes (Natureserve.org). Introduced populations appear well established in urban settings, while the native range is characterized by old fields, pastures, forest edges, meadows, and similar open herbaceous fields. Also found in proximity to water and wetlands (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Hulse et al. 2001; Rossman et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nNE\t-Usually found in areas of sparse vegetation, but cover is important even though it is primarily represented by stone piles and ground litter.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSHGAx", "ELCode": "ARADB36010", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis brachystoma", "ITIS_TSN": "174138", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104011", "common_name": "Short-headed Gartersnake"}}
