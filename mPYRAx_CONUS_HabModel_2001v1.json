Other shrubs found within pygmy rabbit habitat include greasewood (Green and Flinders, 1980a), antelope bitterbrush (Green and Flinders, 1980b), and rabbitbrush (Heady et al., 2001). Specifically, the species is found in areas with greater cover of sagebrush (Weiss and Verts, 1984). For example, Green and Flinders (1980b) observed a mean shrub cover of 46% in sites occupied by pygmy rabbit, versus a mean of 29% for sites from which they were absent. Similarly, Katzner and Parker (1997) observed a mean shrub cover of 43% at occupied sites and 17% at unoccupied sites. Hagar and Lienkaemper (2007) defined shrub cover >40% as suitable for the species, with shrub cover >20% and <40% providing marginal habitat. Likewise, shrub height is another indicator of habitat suitability (Weiss and Verts, 1984), with observed mean shrub heights at occupied sites ranging from 52 cm (Katzner and Parker, 1997) to 86 cm (Hagar and Lienkaemper, 2007), versus unoccupied sites with mean shrubs heights ranging from 25 cm (Green and Flinders, 1980b) to 58 cm (Hagar and Lienkaemper, 2007). Note that though Weiss and Verts (1984) report significantly different values for the species\u2019 shrub cover preferences, their cover calculation methodology was different from those used in other studies. The species avoids recently burned sites, where 13-27 years of growth is required for sufficient vegetative structure to be restored (Woods et al., 2013). Finally, due to the pygmy rabbits\u2019 tendency to burrow as a juvenile (Green and Flinders, 1980a), soil type/depth is another factor that limits its distribution; the species\u2019 has an affinity for deep, sandy loams (Weiss and Verts, 1984; Heady et al., 2001; Hagar and Lienkaemper, 2007; Larrucea and Brussard, 2008).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPYRAx", "ELCode": "AMAEB04010", "scientific_name": "Brachylagus idahoensis", "ITIS_TSN": "552521", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102656", "common_name": "Pygmy Rabbit"}}
