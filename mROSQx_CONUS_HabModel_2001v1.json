rimrock, cliffs, lava fields, canyons, and highway fills, requiring boulders, talus, or tangles of dense vegetation under which to burrow (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Frey 2004).  It will be found anywhere broken terrain exists (especially rocky habitat; New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Open grassland and deserts may support the species if steep-sided arroyos are present where burrows can be excavated, except higher montane forests, though altitude isn't a barrier (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  O. variegatus occurs in oak savanna and woodland, mountain scrub and chaparral, coniferous forest, tundra, marshland, riparian woodland, chaparral woodland, and rock outcrops in cultivated and urban areas (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It is found among sycamore, cottonwood-willow, pinyon-juniper, Apache pine, Chihuahuan pine, ponderosa pine, limber pine, bristlecone pine, white fir, Douglas-fir, spruce-fir, aspen, Western live oak, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, sagebrush, rabbitbrush, winter-fat, broom snakeweed, creosotebush, ocotillo, tarbush, fragrant sumac, fourwing saltbush, redberry juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oak, encinal oak, walnut, apricot and peach trees, mesquite, shinnery oak scrub, bluestem, alkali sacaton, gramma and buffalograss, persimmon-shin oak, sideoats and wheatgrass, tobosa, galleta, ricegrass, and marsh habitat (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  PNV-Douglas-fir - white fir and desertscrub (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). S. variegatus eats squawbush, Apache plume, various grasses, acorns, Ribes species, Ambrosia species, seeds and buds of mesquite, fruit of Opuntia, juniper berries, blooms of Agave, seeds of Ephedra, fruit of Ribes cereum, berries of graythorn, bulbs of mariposa lilies, seeds of serviceberry, lupine, apricots, peaches, hackberry, grapes, walnuts (including black, Texas, and Arizona walnuts), corn, wheat, flowers of skunkbrush and gooseberry, stone fruits, false gromwell, and big prickly pear (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Zeveloff 1988, Bailey 1971, Hall 1995). During extremely hot weather the animals estivate (Zeveloff 1988). The home range size is 0.09ha (Oaks et al. 1987). It occurs at elevations of 0-3,354m (Hoffmeister 1986, Oaks et al. 1987, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). S. variegatus occurs statewide in Arizona except for the extreme southwest (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in central and southern Colorado along the front range and south of the Roan Plateau in western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is present in eastern and southern Nevada (Oaks et al. 1987, Hall 1995). The species occurs throughout New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It is found in central, southern, and southeastern Utah (Durrant 1952, Zeveloff 1988, Utah GAP 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mROSQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB05130", "scientific_name": "Spermophilus variegatus", "ITIS_TSN": "180163", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102556", "common_name": "Rock Squirrel"}}
