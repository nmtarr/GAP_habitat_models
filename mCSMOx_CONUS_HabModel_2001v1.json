They are known to inhabit agricultural land, coastal sand dunes, grassy meadows, sagebrush, deciduous forest, yellow-pine, Douglas fir, redwood, spruce, and hemlock woodlands (Caswell 1953, Dalquest 1948, Glendenning 1959, Ingles 1965, Maser et al. 1981, Yates 1978). In Oregon, Maser et al. (1981) found this species avoids beach, coastal lakes and tidal river habitats (quoted directly from Hartman and Yates 1985). In California, this species is uncommon to common in humid regions of the northern coast. Optimal habitats are wet meadow, annual and perennial grassland, montane riparian, and early successional stages of redwood, Douglas-fir, mixed conifer, and montane hardwood-conifer forests (quoted directly from Harris et al. 2008 [CA WHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). Burrowing soils are preferably light, moist, friable soils, although sand or gravel is sometimes used. Cultivation activites and flooding require the species to vacate habitats used during other times of the year (Zeiner et al. 1990, NatureServe 2014).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCSMOx", "ELCode": "AMABB02020", "scientific_name": "Scapanus orarius", "ITIS_TSN": "179982", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104887", "common_name": "Coast Mole"}}
