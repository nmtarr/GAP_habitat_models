It encompasses areas of South Dakota, and central Indiana. In Mexico, populations occur along the Gulf Coast south into Zacatecas (Natureserve.org; Stebbins 2003). The elevational range has been estimated from near sea level up to 3050 meters (Stebbins 2003). The populations observed on Long Island, New York are most likely the result of introductions (Feinberg 2004 (as referenced by Natureserve.org). This species inhabits riparian areas, but also habitats with bare rock, talus, and scree. Populations are established in deserts, and arid areas where individuals can be observed in cliffs, sand dunes, shrubland, chaparral, suburban settings, orchards, conifer woodland, hardwood woodland, and mixed woodland (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil, fallen logs, and leaf litter, but also in standing snag and hollow trees.  Eggs are laid in soft soil, and underground. The eastern fence lizard is regarded as species that is primarily arboreal. However, several populations are also described as terrestrial, or saxicolus. When active, these lizards are often seen basking in open, sunny situations. During periods of inactivity or hiding, this species retreats to crevices (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nRecent work has split this species into 4 species S. undulatus, S. tristichus, S. cowlesi, and S. consobrinus.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEFLIx", "ELCode": "ARACF14130", "scientific_name": "Sceloporus undulatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173865", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101699", "common_name": "Eastern Fence Lizard"}}
