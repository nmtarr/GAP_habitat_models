They are also associated with gum swamps and other low wet hammock environments (Ashton 1988).  They can be found in ditches, ravine seepages, and slopes above bottomland swamps (Dundee and Rossman 1989).   Individuals are occasionally found far from running water in forest habitats and may disperse into wooded terrestrial habitats in wet weather. They may also sometimes be abundant on limestone, wet shale banks or in and around mines and caves. Larvae live in both spring-fed caves and surface waters (Petranka 1998).  Rocky banks of streams, seeps, or springs provide the salamander with small overhangs or rock stacks from which to suspend its eggs (Martof et al. 1980).  They lay several dozen eggs singly or in small clusters.  Aquatic larvae hatch in 6-8 weeks and metamorphose in a few to several months.  They reach sexual maturity in 1-2 years.
