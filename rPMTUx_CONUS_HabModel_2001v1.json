In more detail, populations are established in the Pascagoula, Leaf, Chickasawhay, Chunky, and lower Escatawpa rivers, and Bogue Homa, Red, Bouie, Bucatunna, Long, Gaines, Oakohay, Okatibbee, Okatoma, Red, Souinlovey, Tallahala, and Tallahoma creeks (Lovich et al. 2009; Selman and Qualls 2009). These habitats are described as big and medium sized rivers characterized by low gradient currents.\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and leaf litter. It is common to find these turtles in rivers that possess an abundance of mollusks, deep pools, sandy banks, and suitable basking objects. This species also is found in shallow water and even into sandy beaches at night. Cover is usually provided by floating, aquatic vegetation (Dundee and Rossman 1989; Lovich and McCoy 1992).\r\n\r\n\r\nMap turtles live strictly in riverine-riparian systems and associated floodplain sloughs, lakes, and ponds. They nest on sandy banks or sand bars, but sometimes can be found up to about 100 m from water bodies.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rPMTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAD05130", "scientific_name": "Graptemys gibbonsi", "ITIS_TSN": "551767", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105841", "common_name": "Pascagoula Map Turtle"}}
