They rarely occur near large standing or flowing water bodies (Petranka 1998).  Typically, they occur in mesic to relatively dry woodlands, but will also use open sites (Petranka 1998) such as meadows and pastureland.  They are somewhat terrestrial, and nonbreeding adults may sometimes be found in forested areas adjacent to streams. In New York, habitat includes tamarack wetlands (Bishop 1941, Axtell and Axtell 1948, Hunsinger 2005). Populations occur at elevations ranging from near sea level to greater than 1500 m although specimens are relatively scarce above 1200m (Petranka 1998).  In the panhandle, restricted to ravines (Carr 1940).  They lay a clutch of 50-100 eggs in fall and the eggs hatch in December-January in South Carolina.  Eggs are attached to underside of rocks in water. The aquatic larval period lasts 27-33 months in Blue Ridge and Piedmont populations, 18-23 months in Coastal Plain of South Carolina (Semlitsch 1983).  They are sexually mature at 4-5 years, maybe sooner for males.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRESAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD13020", "scientific_name": "Pseudotriton ruber", "ITIS_TSN": "173680", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101775", "common_name": "Red Salamander"}}
