In New Mexico, Bufo microscaphus is usually associated with permanent ponds and rocky streams with shallow water flowing over sandy or rocky bottoms, usually in \u201cunaltered\u201d riparian areas where the vegetation is sycamore or cottonwood within grasslands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and ponderosa pine forests (Degenhardt et al. 1996). As opposed to most other true toads (Bufo) in New Mexico, this species is less likely to occupy agricultural fields, irrigation ditches, or broad river bottoms (Degenhardt et al. 1996).  In Arizona, Lowe (1964) described the habitat as being rocky stream canyons and floodplains in Arizona Upland desertscrub and evergreen woodlands of the Mogollon Rim. More recently, Price and Sullivan (1988) described habitat in Arizona as relatively shallow permanent or intermittent flowing water over sandy or rocky substrates, from desert to pine-fir forest. In contrast to Degenhardt et al. (1996), Price and Sullivan (1988) state that \u201cartificial habitats, such as irrigated cropland and reservoirs, are increasingly utilized\u201d.  Jones (1988) recorded the following habitats for Bufo microscaphus:  Ponderosa Pine Woodland, Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, Closed Chaparral, Desert Grassland, Mixed Broadleaf Riparian, Cottonwood-Willow Riparian, Juniper / Mixed Shrub Woodland, Mesquite Bosque / floodplain woodland\r\n\r\nVegetation seems relatively unimportant, as the species seems to occupy mid elevation streams of particular water and substrate characteristics within numerous vegetation zones within its range. Schwaner and Sullivan (2005) list cottonwood, willow, and seep willow as common plants found in lower elevation riparian areas used by southwestern toads. \r\n\r\nELEVATION DESCRIPTION\r\nStebbins describes the species (including Bufo californicus) as occurring from near sea level to around 6000 ft (1830 m) in the U.S. (and up to 8500 ft/2590 m in Mexico). However, Price and Sullivan (1988) describe the overall range (including Mexico) as from about 90-3025 m. In New Mexico, occurs from 1900-2700 m (Degenhardt et al. 1996). \r\n\r\nHYDROLOGY\r\nUsually associated with permanent ponds and rocky streams with shallow water flowing over sandy or rocky bottoms (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Breeds at the edges of streams or shallows, backwashes, and side pools where flow is minimal (Schwaner and Sullivan 2005). Jones (1988) recorded the species from rocky sites, with permanent water at all sites.\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION INFORMATION\r\nStebbins (1985) describes distribution as ranging from southern Nevada to southern Durango, Mexico, and also from coastal southern California to northwest Baja California, occurring in many isolated populations. The western populations are currently regarded as a distinct species, the Arroyo Toad (Bufo californicus). In New Mexico, the species is known from Catron, Grant, and Sierra, and Socorro counties, and is common along the rivers and lakes of the Gila and San Francisco river drainages (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Price and Sullivan (1988) described the distribution as a series of isolated populations along the Mogollon Plateau of SW New Mexico to the Colorado and Virgin River basins in NW Arizona, S Nevada, and SW Utah. Recorded in SW Utah at Zion National Park (Nowak et al. 2002) and SE Utah at Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (Oliver 2003).  Recent range extensions in Arizona include Pinto Creek at Forest Road 287, the first record on the south side of Roosevelt Lake (Seim 1994), and Clear Creek at Hamilton Crossing, which extended the range 10 km further downstream from Mack\u2019s Crossing (Sullivan 1993) and suggests they may be more widespread in drainages north of the Mogollon Rim (DeMarais and Waters 1994). Schwaner and Sullivan (2005) state that current distribution is likely similar to historic distribution, except that in some areas of Arizona and southern Nevada they are being replaced by Woodhouse\u2019s toads.\r\n\r\nMISC.\r\nKey features of habitat within the species\u2019 range appear to be streams that are relatively shallow, and rocky or sandy substrates (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Lowe 1964, Price and Sullivan 1988).  Streamside vegetation is typically willow or cottonwood, with surrounding vegetation ranging from grasslands and \u201cArizona Upland desertscrub\u201d to Ponderosa Pine forest (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Lowe 1964, Price and Sullivan, 1988).  Sources differ on the tendency of this species to use artificial habitats such as reservoirs and irrigated fields (cf. Degenhardt et al. 1996 and Price and Sullivan 1988).  Jones (1988) recorded the following habitats for Bufo microscaphus:  Ponderosa Pine Woodland, Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, Closed Chaparral, Desert Grassland, Mixed Broadleaf Riparian, Cottonwood-Willow Riparian, Juniper / Mixed Shrub Woodland, Mesquite Bosque / floodplain woodland.  Sources specific to the Southwest GAP area list elevation range as 900 m (based on record south of Roosevelt Lake; Seim 1994) to 2700 m (Degenhardt et al. 1996, for NM).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aAZTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01110", "scientific_name": "Anaxyrus microscaphus", "ITIS_TSN": "773525", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105766", "common_name": "Arizona Toad"}}
