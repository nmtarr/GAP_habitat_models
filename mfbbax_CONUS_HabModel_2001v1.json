It occurs in southern Florida and is known to roost singly or in groups in tree cavities, bat houses, limestone rock outcrops, under roofing tiles, in palms, attics, rock or brick chimneys, and limestone outcrops.  It is closely associated with forested areas because of roosting habits.\r\n\r\nFlorida Bonneted Bats are relatively large and well adapted for prolonged flights in open areas.  Echolocation calls have been recorded in: pine flatwoods, pine rocklands, cypress, mixed- and hardwood hammocks, mangroves, wetlands, rivers, lakes, canals, residential urban areas, tropical gardens, swamp, oxbows, and pasture.  At Babcock-Webb WMA, calls were only recorded in pinelands even though dry prairie, freshwater marsh, and wet prairie were available.  This species is also known to occur at a golf course.  Foraging distances are not known.
