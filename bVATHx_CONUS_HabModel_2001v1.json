It is commonly associated with old growth but will occur in second growth forests as well.  It is widespread from fall to spring in the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada.  Numbers are often augmented in winter by those that migrate from more northerly areas.  \r\n\r\nGeneral habitat associations include forest-conifer, hardwood forests, mixed forest, shrubland/chaparral, and woodlands (NatureServe 2004).  Habitats providing ground shading are preferred (CA WHR, downloaded 07/09/2003).  \r\n\r\nIn George\u2019s (2000) description of Varied Thrush habitat, he emphasized its association with old growth forests and their wet, mossy shade.  He listed habitat associations for a variety of locations: coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western red cedar, and red alder (Alnus rubra) forests of California, Oregon, and Washington; wet montane forests of (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock, and western red cedar in Oregon and Washington; western larch (Larix occidentalis)\u2013Douglas fir forests of Montana; Douglas fir, western hemlock, western red cedar, and Sitka spruce forests with an understory and mossy ground cover in British Columbia.  It occurs in logged and burned forests with cascara and dogwood growth (George 2000).  California Redwood forests; Oregon Coast Range, Oregon Cascades, and Washington Cascades Douglas-fir; Montana western larch-Douglas-fir forests; and Coastal Islands on Vancouver Island have the highest breeding densities (George 2000).  \r\n\r\n16ha appears to be the minimum patch size for breeding in northern California (George 2000).\r\n\r\nWinter habitat associations are more general than summer.  In addition to suitable breeding habitats, they occur where fruits and berries are available in tall chaparral, dense oak woodlands, recently logged forests, riparian areas, parks, and gardens (George 2000).\r\n\r\nN.
