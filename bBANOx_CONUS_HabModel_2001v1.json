They use young forest plantations, where they hunt for small mammals (Johnsgard 1988). They are often found in or near towns, where they may nest in man-made structures (AOU 1983, Ehrlich et al. 1988). Dense grass fields are the chief foraging habitat, including salt marsh, wet meadows, lightly grazed pastures, grass hayfields, and recently abandoned agricultural fields (Colvin 1980, 1984, 1985; Rosenburg 1986; Gubanyi 1989). Radiotelemetry studies indicate that these habitats are actively selected (Colvin 1984, Rosenburg 1986, Gubanyi 1989). Furthermore, the quantity and quality of dense grass habitats are significantly correlated with nest activity (Colvin and Hegdal 1988). Other habitats occasionally used include alfalfa/grass (Colvin 1984), small grain (Ault 1971, Rosenburg 1986), fencelines, and roadsides (Ault 1971, Byrd 1982). In an intensively farmed area in eastern Virginia where grass availability was very low, barn owls foraged in small grain, a five-year-old clearcut, barnyards, and a pine  plantation used as a blackbird roost (Rosenburg 1986). Cultivated habitats in general are of little importance to the barn owl because of low prey populations and/or dense protective cover (Colvin 1984, Rosenburg 1986).   Foraging habitat limited by nest site availability such as hollow trees, riverbanks, nestboxes, and human structures (Marti 1992).  Nest site habitat features are fine scale and we can not model them directly.\r\n\r\n\tIt appears that barn owls will use any preexisting large natural or man-made cavity for nesting.  Barn Owls require fairly large cavities for nesting (Nicholson 1997), although they appear to be adaptable in the types of  nest sites they find acceptable (Marti 1988). They have been reported to nest in a variety of cavities and/or protected sites such as: abandoned buildings, belfries (Hamel 1992), tree cavities, cliff crevices, nest boxes (Ehrlich et al.), under-ground burrows, sides of old wells, and abandoned mining shafts (Bent 1938). They may also be found nesting in the steep walls of ravines (Konig 1999).\r\nAlthough cut bank burrows and cliff recesses are frequently used in the western U.S. (Otteni et al. 1972, Martin 1973, Rudolph 1978, Millsap and Millsap 1987, Gubanyi 1989), only a few cases of the use of such sites have been reported in the Northeast. R. Ferren (pers. comm.) described barn owl nest holes in the steep bluffs on the north and south ends of Block Island, Rhode Island. Recesses in a clay embankment along the Patuxent River in Maryland supported a breeding pair during the late 1980s (S. Smith, pers. comm.). Exposed barrels in a cut bank along the Rappahannock River of eastern Virginia supported approximately 15 nesting pairs in the late 1970s (S. Doggett, pers. comm.).\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nMain food source is small mammals, mainly Microtus, Blarina, Thomomys, Spermophilus, Perognathus, Dipodomys, and Peromyscus (Marti 1992).  Has ability to hunt prey at night and by sound and is the most accurate of any animal that has been tested (Marti 1992).  Use of suitable foraging habitat is limited by nest cavity requirements (Marti 1992).  Readily used: hollow trees, cavities in cliffs and riverbanks, nest boxes and other human structures (Marti 1992).  Recently, much of this species' habitat has been compromised due to changes in land use practices (Marti 1992).  Mean home range has been observed to be anywhere from 198 ha to 921 ha (NatureServe 2001).  Distance from nest site to forage area can range from 1.6 km (typical) to 5.6 km (Marti 1992).  Breeding range occurs at low elevations in open habitats such as grasslands, deserts, marshes and fields (Marti 1992).  Will nest in old barns, church and school steeples, silos or abandoned buildings, protected areas along cliff faces, abandoned underground burrows, caves, cavities in high stream banks, and abandoned nests (NatureServe 2001).  Will return to the same site year after year if undisturbed (Marti 1992).  Avoids woodlands, nests in forest edges (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Minimum DBH >51 cm for nesting; thought to be becoming more common because of reduction in predators such as prairie falcons; cannot survive at higher elevations; home range varies according to habitat characteristics and prey populations; difficult to find specific alliances because can survive in many different habitats.  Prefers hunting areas with mountain mahogany, skunkbush, blue grama-buffalograss, cottonwood.  Areas with less than 40 percent cover are preferred (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Avoids deep woodlands (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Occurs in desert, grassland, trees and cliffs in riparian and grassland areas, man-made structures, and agricultural areas (Marti 1992, Kingery 1998)\r\n\r\nIn winter in Arizona, it nests in saltcedar and riparian mesquite, and in desert washes (Glinski 1998). It is present in desertscrub  (Glinski 1998). Is commonly found in the Colorado desert in southern California roosting in palm oases, mine addits, and cliffs (Verner and Boss 1980).  Not common in New Mexico, as there are not many suitable nesting sites (Ligon 1961).  This species is a statewide resident in Nevada, with highest densities found in agricultural and riparian areas (Alcorn, 1988).  Is a fairly common resident throughout the lower Colorado River Valley, roosting and nesting in tall trees, buildings, and cliffs (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In summer in this valley, this species is often found in thickets of tall saltcedar and screwbean mesquite; feeds primarily over agricultural lands but also hunts over adjacent desert habitats.  This species is the most likely owl to be found in towns.  In Arizona, this species is a fairly common resident throughout most of the open Sonoran zones except in the deserts of the southwest (Phillips et al. 1964).  In Arizona this owl has been found roosting in old mines, wells, buildings, large cottonwoods and willows, palm tree rows in towns, and stacks of baled hay (Phillips et al. 1964).  In Colorado, this species lives in natural tree cavities and cliffs in riparian and grassland areas.  Also in Colorado this bird likes to nest in buildings-churches, ruins, lofts, and barns (Kingery 1988). This species occurs below 1,280m in Arizona (Glinski 1998). It occurs below 1,829m in Colorado and 2,439m in New Mexico (Kingery 1998, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).\r\n\r\nIn southern California (Garrett and Dunn 1981, p. 211), \u2026 \u201cmost abundant in agricultural regions with scattered ranchlands and groves of trees, \u2026 and in other areas where grasslands intermix with groves, cliffs, and buildings\u2026\u201d; also scattered in desert regions and on most of the Channel Islands; along the coast, widespread in suburban residential areas. (quoted directly from Marti et al. 2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn British Columbia (Campbell et al. 1990), mostly in association with agricultural areas, but also frequents grasslands, river bottom meadows, and (less so) cities and residential areas. (quoted directly from Marti et al. 2005).\r\n\r\n\r\nNortheast:\r\nIn Massachusetts (Viet and Petersen 1993), most prevalent along coastal marshes and on coastal islands with scattered fields, marshes, and woodlots. In southern New Jersey in fall, coastal marsh and field habitats, as well as open fields in early stages of succession to forest (red cedar [Juniperus virginiana]; Duffy and Kerlinger 1992).
