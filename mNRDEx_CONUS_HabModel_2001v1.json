It is associated with foothill shrubs (mountain mahogany, scrub oak, bitterbrush, oaks), pinyon-juniper, short grass steppe, Great Basin grass, Chihuahuan Desert grassland, montane riparian habitat, barren land, and coniferous forests (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It is found among Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, redberry juniper, cottonwood, alder, willow, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, grama and buffalograss, tobosa, galleta, ricegrass, oakbrush, mountain-mahogany, choke cherry, and bitterbrush as well as skunkbrush (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It is strongly associated with rock outcrops, especially granitic and limestone (Thompson et al. 1996). It is also found on talus slopes and in caves (Thompson et al. 1996). P. nasutus lives in rocky canyons, cliffs, cuestas, and exposed hogbacks with numerous cracks, fissures, and overhanging ledges (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Rock outcrops are a limiting factor (Thompson et al. 1996).  It lives in groups of large rocks or boulders, usually in pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands (Findley et al. 1975).  It is common in lava rocks/malpais (Findley et al. 1975).  Elevation was derived from specimen locations and is between 915 and 2,741 meters (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996). The species occurs in the the Chiricahua, White, and Chuska mountains, and Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986). P. nasutus occurs in central and southern Colorado excluding the San Juan Basin (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs throughout New Mexico except in the San Juan Basin and most of the Llano Estacado (Frey 2004). It is only found in the extreme southeast of Utah (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997). It may occur in the Chupadera Mountains (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mNRDEx", "ELCode": "AMAFF03140", "scientific_name": "Peromyscus nasutus", "ITIS_TSN": "552496", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104292", "common_name": "Northern Rock Deermouse"}}
