Cliffs and canyon walls are used as feeding roosts, where prey is dismantled and eaten (Loeb et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nCool, well ventilated caves are preferred for hibernation and warmer caves are used by maternity colonies (NatureServe 2013).\r\n\r\nVirginia Big-eared Bats may move up to 11 km from maternity caves to foraging areas (Loeb et al. 2011).  One study of foraging behavior in West Virginia found that 60% of foraging areas were within 5km of individual\u2019s cave roost and 80.5 % was within 6 km (Loeb et al. 2011).  Open areas (hayfields, corn fields, and old fields) were used more than they occurred in random plots, but were not used as much as forests (Loeb et al. 2011; NatureServe 2013).  These bats likely forage in open areas and above forests as well, without focusing on forest edges specifically (Loeb et al. 2011).  N.
