This species' range was delimited using Hoffmeister (1986) for Arizona and Findley et al. (1975) for New Mexico.  Range should be constrained by mountain ranges \u2013 these are the Huachuca, Pajarito, Patagonia, Santa Rita (Hoffmeister 1986), and Animas Mountains, Hidalgo County (Findley et al. 1975; Cook 1986).  In Arizona, it occurs in the southernmost portion of the state within the Atascosa, Huachuca, Pajarito, Patagonia, Santa Rita Mountains (Hoffmeister 1986).  In New Mexico, this species is restricted to the Animas Mountains, Hidalgo County (Findley et al. 1975; Cook 1986).  Kerley et al. (in press) suggest this species is not known to occur throughout New Mexico; he based this assertion on the results of an extensive trapping effort by the New Mexico State University.  It was also trapped within Clark County, Nevada (n = 1; Bradley and Mauer 1973).\r\n\r\nHabitat:\r\nEncinal/ Pine-Oak/ Pine-Oak-Juniper Woodlands:  In southeastern Arizonan mountains, this species occurs within or near the oak belt (Hoffmeister 1963, 1986) along grassy rocky slopes (Hoffmeister 1963).  Cook (1986) collected specimens in an arroyo dominated by apache plume with oak and pinyon-juniper on surrounding hillsides.  In the Patagonia Mountains, they live in open oak woodlands (Hoffmeister 1986).  In the Huachuca Mountains, it occurs on rocky slopes covered with oak, juniper, agave, mountain mahogany and sumac with various grasses including Andropogon (Hoffmeister 1986). Near Pena Blanca Spring, a small colony was observed within the rocky soil supported with oaks and mimosa but with little other vegetation (Hoffmeister 1986).  Near Greaterville, on the east side of the Santa Rita Mountains, this species was taken on a high, rocky slope among agave (Hoffmeister 1986).\r\n\r\nPine forest:  In New Mexico, it is \u201climited to the higher timbered parts of the Animas Mountains, Hidalgo County;\u201d specimens were collected within pine forest (Findley et al. 1975).\r\n\r\nMixed Conifer:  One specimen was collected within a clearing of pine and Douglas fir (Hoffmeister 1986).  \r\n\r\nVegetation Structure:  Foraging ecology \u2013  In some places, this species feeds on agave stalks (Hoffmeister 1986).\r\n\r\nBurrow ecology \u2013 Burrows are small in diameter, often shallow and frequently circuitous in configuration to fit between buried rocks (Hoffmeister 1986).\r\n\r\nElevational Range:  At Indian Creek, Animas Mountains, New Mexico, this species was collected between 1798 to 1989 meters elevation (n = 4; Cook 1986).  However, this species is in greatest abundance between 1676 to 1981 meters elevation (Cook 1986). West of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, this mouse was trapped at around 2500 feet (n = 1; Bradley and Mauer 1973).  However, the Nevada record is questionable.  Consequently, the New Mexico information has a small n-value and is from only one of the five mountain ranges.  Therefore, it is not representative of this species range and fails to satisfy EDR 5.  Therefore, this information is excluded from the modeling effort.\r\n\r\nTopography:  It occurs along rocky slopes of southeastern Arizonan mountains (Hoffmeister 1963).  \r\n\r\nSoils/ Strata:  It occurs in rocky and shallow soils (Hoffmeister 1963, 1986).  In Sycamore Canyon, this species was found in soils so rocky it was difficult to dig (Hoffmeister 1986).  In the Huachuca Mountains, it occurs on rocky slopes (Hoffmeister 1986).  In New Mexico, Animas Mountains, it occurs in \u201cvery shallow, rocky soils\u201d (Findley et al. 1975).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSPGOe", "ELCode": "AMAFC01011", "scientific_name": "Thomomys umbrinus intermedius", "ITIS_TSN": "180230", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103490", "common_name": "Southern Pocket Gopher"}}
