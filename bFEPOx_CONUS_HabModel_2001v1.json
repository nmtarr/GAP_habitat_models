Small areas of range in Arizona and Texas comprise the northern extent of the species range.  Numerous subspecies are recognized, but there is uncertainty about their ranges and systematics in northern Mexico, Arizona, and Texas.  However it is believed that individuals in Texas and Arizona are of the cactorum subspecies.  USGAP has ranges and models for both Glaucidium brasilianum and Glaucidium brasilianum cactorum, but they are identical.\r\nIt is identified in Arizona as occurring in lowland areas within riparian areas (Proudfoot and Johnson 2000) characterized by cottonwoods (Populous fremontii) and willow (Salix spp.) with adjacent mesquite bosques (usually with saguaros on nearby slopes; AGFD 2001).  In Arizona, in desert settings, saguaro and mesquite are used as cavity nest sites (Proudfoot and Johnson 2000).  \r\n\r\nDue to the dramatic reduction in mesic riparian forests and associated mesquite bosques, the remaining segment of this population in Arizona generally occupy xeroriparian and upland areas densely vegetated with trees and saguaro cacti (USFWS 2003).  This species is also known to occur within semidesert and Sonoran savanna grasslands with xeroriparian washes (e.g., the Altar Valley; USFWS 2003). Dominant tree species in riparian areas include mesquite, ash, and hackberry (Celtis spp.).  Uplands in these areas primarily consist of grasslands with dispersed mesquite trees, and very few, isolated saguaro cacti in some areas (USFWS 2003).\r\n\r\nMultiple cavities are required for caching food, as well as secondary nest sites if the first nest is depredated (Proudfoot and Johnson 2000).  \r\n\r\nIn Arizona, cottonwood, saguaro, ash and mesquite are used as cavity nest sites (Proudfoot and Johnson 2000).  Due to alteration of riparian habitats, Cartron et al. (2000) assert saguaro cavities may now be the most important nesting strata.  Multiple cavities are required for caching food, as well as secondary nest sites if the first nest is depredated (Proudfoot and Johnson 2000).  Nest cavities are located between 2 to 12 meters from ground (n = 99; Proudfoot and Johnson 2000).  Breeding territories are usually centered on large desert washes and contain several nest cavities (Proudfoot and Johnson 2000).  \r\n\r\nElevational range is between 300 and 1220 meters elevation (Lesh and Corman 1995; Proudfoot and Johnson 2000; AGFD 2001).   In Arizona, this species occurs between 1,300 to 4,000 ft (397 \u2013 1,220m) elevation (AGFD 2001).  Proudfoot and Johnson (2000) assert this species rarely occurs below 300m or above 1,300 m elevation.  USFWS (2003) cited this elevational range within the species draft recovery plan.  Lesh and Corman (1995) suggest the species is found below 4000ft (1200m).  In the United States, this species occurs only within Arizona.  The elevational ranges provided represent different studies within the state.  Therefore using EDR 3, these elevational ranges may be combined.  The combined elevational range for Arizona is 300 to 1220 meters.\r\n\r\nUnmated males may establish a territory with a floating core area 100-150m radius, which is usually centered in a wash (Proudfoot and Johnson 2000).  Because this is an estimate of territory size for unmated males within Arizona, it is considered representative, and may be used in model development.  SWreGAP/N.
