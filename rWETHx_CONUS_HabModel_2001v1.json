In New Mexico, this species is associated with low elevation habitats near the Pecos, Rio Grande, and Gila river drainages and areas pertaining to Antelope pass, Hidalgo County, Carlsbad, Eddy County, and Las Cruces, Dona Ana County. Areas near these major drainages are suitable for burrowing, but also tributary arroyos with a combination of slopes and surface rocks represent an appropriate habitat (Degenhardt et al. 1996).
