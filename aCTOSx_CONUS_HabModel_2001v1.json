Populations extend from the Little Nestucca River system in Tillamook County, Oregon, and the Chehalis River in Gray\u2019s Harbor County, Washington (Good and Wake 1992; McAllister 1995). This species is found from near sea level to the highest point in their range, Boisfort Peak at 948 meters in the Willapa Hills of southwestern Washington, and in Saddleback Mountain at 1001 meters in the coast ranges of northwestern Oregon (Green et al. 2013). The species is also found in a few of the upper reaches of the coastal region of the Willamette basin, to include the Upper Grand Ronde system in Oregon (Good et al. 1987).\r\nHabitat includes near coastal perennial headwater streams found within a managed forest (Wilkins and Peterson 2000). This species was reported more frequent in streams of basalt formations than in streams on marine sediments. Egg deposition sites include sandstone sites on side slope seeps (Russel et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCTOSx", "ELCode": "AAAAJ01040", "scientific_name": "Rhyacotriton kezeri", "ITIS_TSN": "550251", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103633", "common_name": "Columbia Torrent Salamander"}}
