Its range continues south to eastern Texas, the Gulf Coast, and Central Florida (Ashton and Ashton 1991; Bartlett and Bartlett 1999; Conant and Collins 1998). Cooper (1988) has reported occurrences of this species in western Oklahoma, central Texas, and southern Florida, but require further confirmation.\r\n\r\nThe habitat occupied by this species includes wooded areas and woodland margins. Stable populations have been reported across various soil types and moisture levels. In Florida, this species occurs in hammocks, cypress heads, swamps, vacant lots, and barrier islands. These skinks occupy old woodpecker holes and other hollows. In South Carolina, large live oaks and dense bushes are preferably occupied by this species (Cooper 1993). Adults are reportedly more common in oak hollows or on the ground, while juveniles occur more often on walls, palmettos, or on the ground (Cooper and Vitt 1994).\r\n\r\nAssociated with large, live oaks that have woodpecker holes and provide a fringe of dense bush cover. Juveniles are found on walls, palmettos, while avoiding pines.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rBHSKx", "ELCode": "ARACH01080", "scientific_name": "Plestiodon laticeps", "ITIS_TSN": "173961", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100658", "common_name": "Broad-headed Skink"}}
