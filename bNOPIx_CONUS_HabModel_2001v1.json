This may include lakes, rivers, marshes and ponds within grasslands, barrens, dry tundra and open boreal forest or cultivated fields (NatureServe 2009).  Densities of breeding pairs have been positively correlated with the total area of wetlands per square kilometer, as well as the number of seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands present (Stewart and Kantrud 1973)\r. Nests are typically located on islands in shallow basins, or in upland cover along roadsides, fencerows or in pastures. Broods will utilize shallow seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands with a high amount of emergent vegetation for food and cover (Mack and Flake 1980, Kaminski and Prince 1984, \rAustin and Miller 1995).\r\n\r\nIn migration and winter, Northern Pintail will utilize shallow, unfrozen wetlands, larger lakes, estuarine and riverine wetlands, as well as mud flats, tidal pools, and brackish ponds (Euliss and Harris 1987, Baldassarre and Bolen 1984, Austin and Miller 1995). May forage in dry grain and flooded rice or soybean fields during fall and winter (Baldassarre and Bolen 1984, Austin and Miller 1995).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bNOPIx", "ELCode": "ABNJB10110", "scientific_name": "Anas acuta", "ITIS_TSN": "175074", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103829", "common_name": "Northern Pintail"}}
