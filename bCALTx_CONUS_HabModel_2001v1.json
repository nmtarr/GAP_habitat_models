They inhabit hard Chaparral consisting of common buckbrush, or wedgeleaf ceanothus (Ceanothus cuneatus), and oaks in southwest Oregon; chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) and common buckbrush, manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), holly-leaf cherry (Prunus ilicifolia), California lilac (Ceanothus spp.), buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides), scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), sumac (Rhus spp.), and several other shrub species in California;  and numerous oaks, California madrone (Arbutus menziesii), digger or foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana), and Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri; Benedict et al. 2011).  They also inhabit soft Chaparral of black (Salvia mellifera) and purple (S. leucophylla) sage, California (Artemisia californica) and other sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), and buckwheats (Eriogonum spp.; Benedict et al. 2011).  Inland populations inhabit dry canyon bottoms and riparian systems within desert systems that include blackberries (Rubus), gooseberries (Ribes spp.), willows (Salix spp.), elder berries (Sambucus spp.), alder (Alnus spp.), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), and western sycamore (Platanus racemosa; Zeiner et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nBenedict et al. (2011) stated that the California Towhee is an edge species that utilizes \u201cdense vegetation for escape, cover, and nesting interspersed with openings for foraging,\u201d and Zeiner et al. (1990) stated that it commonly uses the edges of dense chaparral and brushy edges of densely wooded habitats.  \r\n\r\nThese birds are reportedly most common between sea level and 1,525 m but known to occur at 1,890 m in southern California (Palomar Mountain; Benedict et al. 2011).  In Yosemite National Park, they are common below 760 m, uncommon and local up to 1,220 m, but known to rarely occur up to 2,375 m (Benedict et al. 2011).  N.
