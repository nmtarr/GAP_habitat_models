Often in mixed hardwood forest and bottomlands with permanent water source. Seasonal changes in habitat use are linked to food availability.  \"In Florida, the wild pig usually inhabits areas with a mixture of habitats, including relatively open areas for foraging and denser areas for resting.  In the southern Appalachians, it frequents the higher elevations, where it lives in mixed wooded and open areas.\" (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nIn Californai, CAWHR describes habitat: \"Feral and introduced, permanent resident at low to middle elevations at scattered locations in cismontane California. Common, and increasing in numbers, in local areas. Occur in riparian areas, oak woodlands, annual grasslands, mature conifer and hardwood forests with moderate to high-canopy closure, and in chaparral and other brush areas. Mast crops, especially acorns, important. Adjacent agricultural lands enhance habitat. Barrett (1977) estimated that more than 30,000 wild pigs occur in California, making them the second most important big game species.\"([Ahlborn & White in CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Oregon, feral hogs inhabit swamps, brushlands, riparian areas, forest, and edges of agricultural fields.\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, preferred habitat is diverse forested areas with openings, an abundant litter layer and/or ground vegetation for foraging on invertebrates, roots, and tubers. Additionally, marsh and grass-sedge flats with wild grapes are utilized in coastal regions.
