It is perhaps most frequently found in rocky gorges that are covered with mesic hardwood forest (Redmond and Scott 1996), but red spruce-yellow birch and dry forest types are also suitable (Petranka 1998).  They are found in rock crevices, under rocks, logs, and leaves, and in twilight zone of caves (at lower elevations).  Courtship occurs in the fall and spring and eggs are laid in damp logs, moss, cave crevices, and other protected sites.  The eggs are laid from March to April in New York and in January-March in Pennsylvania.  Wehrle\u2019s salamander reaches sexual maturity in 4-5 years.  In West Virginia, they have been found at sites between 183 and 1463 m (Petranks 1998) Stacy Smith, 15April05 and N.
