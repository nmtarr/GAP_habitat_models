They have subsequently spread to the San Andreas Mountains, and the Jornada and Tularosa basins (Hoenes and Bender 2010). This species has been known to do well in very hot conditions with little to no surface water present and are found in a variety of habitat types on WSMR and surounding areas. Oryx primarly feed on grass but will also eat shrubs and other vegetation. They have been regarded as aggressive and actively compete with native ungulates for forage.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mGEMSx", "ELCode": "AMALE11010", "scientific_name": "Oryx gazella", "ITIS_TSN": "625180", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101581", "common_name": "Gemsbok"}}
