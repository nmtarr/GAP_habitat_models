Inhabits a variety of arid and semiarid (usually relatively sparsely vegetated) upland habitats, with loose sandy to clayey soils (Manning and Jones 1988). In Colorado, they are restricted to grasslands along the western margin of the plains and to shrub-grassland of the northern part of the state (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). They have also been captured in ponderosa pine with an understory of yucca (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In northeastern Utah and northwestern Colorado, olive\u2013backed pocket mice occur in sandy to gravel soils in semidesert shrublands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Utah found on sandy soil or mixed with fine gravel with dominant vegetation of sagebrush (Manning and Jones 1988). They seem to have a preference for sites with loamy sand to clay soils and low vegetation cover, often with a substantial amount of bare ground (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Vegetation associations include blue grama, needle-grass, and wheat-grass (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The elevation minimum (1525 m) is from Colorado Wildlife Species Database (Schrupp and Cade 1989). Maximum elevation of the range in Colorado's Wet Mountains is reported as 2500 m (Armstrong et al. 1973, Manning and Jones 1988).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains/Upper Midwest:\r\nIn Montana, P. fasciatus inhabits a wide variety of grassland and soil types including grazed and ungrazed meadows on sandy soils, shortgrass and sagebrush near sandy draws and other sage-grassland types (Montana Natural Heritage Program 2015). It is a resident of grassland, shrub-steppe, and desert scrub habitats in the north Great Plains and intermountain basins preferring semi-arid and bunchgrass habitats other species of Perognathus do not. They also have a preference (similar to other pocket mice) for sand and sandy-loam soils for \"bathing\" (Wilson and Ruff 1999). In southwestern North Dakota, Turner and Bowles (1967) captured this species on sandy floodplains within 100 yards of the Little Missouri River in scattered cottonwood, Bromus grasses, multiflora rose thickets, and sage. In south-central South Dakota, Wilhelm et al. (1981) captured this species in transitional upland grassy habitats with bare soils between vegetation clumps. In Nebraska, Jones (1964) found P. fasciatus on dry hillsides of scattered rocky outcroppings with yucca, sparse grasses, and occasional ponderosa pine. They may also be found on the edge of aspen parklands (Banfield 1974).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mOBPMx", "ELCode": "AMAFD01010", "scientific_name": "Perognathus fasciatus", "ITIS_TSN": "180260", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105335", "common_name": "Olive-backed Pocket Mouse"}}
