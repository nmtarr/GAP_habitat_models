It inhabits systems ranging from semiarid alpine to rich stream beds including talus, scree, alpine meadows, rocky outcrops, subalpine meadows, and herbaceous grasslands (Barash 1989, NatureServe 2014). \r\nHoary and Yellow-bellied Marmots appear to displace one another in areas of where their ranges overlap (e.g., Purcell and Flint Creek Ranges in Montana); Yellow-bellied Marmots occupy lower elevations while Hoary Marmots occupy high elevations.  In parts of northern Wyoming and southern Montana, Hoary Marmots are absent at the higher elevation sites and they are therefore occupied by Yellow-bellied Marmots.  N.
