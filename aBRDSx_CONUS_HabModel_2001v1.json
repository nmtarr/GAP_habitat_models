At lower elevations and in winter, this salamander usually concentrates near seepage areas, springs, and small streams, but is more terrestrial at higher elevations and in wet weather.  They are characteristic inhabitants of spruce-fir forests.  This species is confined to mountainous forested habitats at the most northerly portion of the southern Appalachians in Tennessee, North Carolina and Virginia (Petranka 1998).  Within its range, the Blue Ridge dusky salamander occurs on mountain peaks, but lower elevational limits are not well defined.  Eggs are laid in wet rock crevices or under rocks, logs, or moss in seepage areas or near small streams.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBRDSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03150", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus orestes", "ITIS_TSN": "550245", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106222", "common_name": "Blue Ridge Dusky Salamander"}}
