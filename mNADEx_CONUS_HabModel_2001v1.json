The taxonomy of this species is uncertain, however, and may actually include populations that warrant species status.  Numerous subspecies are currently recognized and have more restrictive habitat needs than the species as a whole.  Some are described below.\r\n\r\nDeer Mice use a wide variety of upland and riparian habitats from open areas and brushlands to coniferous and deciduous forests. The range of this species extends southward from general forested habitats in the northeastern United States and Canada to the southeastern limit of its breeding range in the southern Appalachians, where, in North Carolina, it occurs on mountain slopes and peaks and in some foothill locations (Lee et al. 1982, Brown 1997).\r\n\r\nWithin the southern Appalachian region, the species is largely associated with cool, moist mixed conifer and deciduous forests or conifer forests (Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), and also with deciduous forests which contain evergreen shrub thickets (Webster et al. 1985). Rocky, mossy conditions or areas with numerous downed and decaying logs and stumps are favorable nesting and denning sites (Webster et al. 1985).\r\n\r\nP. m. bairdii prefers open weedfield, abandoned cropland, grasslands, sandy areas and any place cleared of trees (Barbour & Davis 1974, Whitaker & Hamilton 1998).  P.m. nubiterrae uses woodland, mixed woods, conifers, hardwoods. It is found in all habitats in higher mountian elevation and restricted to dense forests of birch, beech, and maple where forest floor stays cool and moist - farther down mountians (Barbout & Davis 1974).  \r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, P. maniculatus occurs in tundra, Rocky Mountain alpine and subalpine grassland, plains grassland, open, sparsely vegetated deserts, warm temperate swamp and riparian forests, and Sonoran desertscrub (Thompson et al. 1996, Davis and Schmidly 1997). PNV (BLM) - Shortgrass prairies, sactan grassland, and sycamore and rabbitbrush riparian (Thompson et al. 1996). The species is most common in ponderosa, mixed coniferous, and spruce - fir forests; next most common in northern sage-grassland; and much less common in woodland, grassland, and desert communities (Thompson et al. 1996). In more southern areas, the species may inhabit sandy areas with P. leucopus (Thompson et al. 1996). In southern New Mexico, the indigenous species of Peromyscus in the woodland zone act as a barrier between the montane and lowland populations of P. maniculatus (Thompson et al. 1996).  In Colorado, it is found in all habitats with cover, except well-developed wetlands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It avoids poorly drained soils (Thompson et al. 1996). It occurs in most habitats at all elevations in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). P. maniculatus exploits disturbed habitats: overgrazed, cleared, mined, construction sites, burned, and avalanche or landslide areas (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It should be found in all the mountains of New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  P. maniculatus occurs among aspen, cottonwood - willow, pinyon - juniper, bristlecone pine, limber pine, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, saltcedar, Russian olive, crested wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, sixweeks fescue, Indian ricegrass, sand sage, winter-fat, creosote, tarbush, ocotillo, redberry juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, shinnery oak scrub, sedges, grama and buffalograss, galleta, big bluestem, sand bluestem, alkali sacaton, tobosa, bluejoint, ricegrass, alder, Apache plume, mesquite, rushes, cattails, three-awn-finger grass, bluejoint - switchgrass, sand plum thickets, saltcedar - groundsel tree, yucca, beargrass, allthorn, ephedra, and ribes (Thompson et al. 1996).  It eats almost anything - seeds, carrion, bone, fungi, leaves, and bark (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  \r\n\r\nThe home range is 0.2ha (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The elevation is 305-3963m (Thompson et al. 1996).  P. maniculatus occurs throughout the southwest (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Hall 1995, Utah GAP 1997, Frey 2004).
