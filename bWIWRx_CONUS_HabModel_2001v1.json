Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. 279 pp."}, "habitat_description": "The Winter Wren (Troglodytes hiemalis) breeds in a wide range of environments within its range: treeless islands, heath balds, deciduous riparian areas, cliff faces, hardwood forests, mixed conifer-hardwood forests, and conifer forests (Hefl et al. 2002).  However, regional associations can be more restricted.  It is associated with old growth forests in the northwestern U.S., moist coniferous forests in the eastern U.S., and appears to be sensitive to forest fragmentation (Hefl et al. 2002).  It is frequently associated with water, whether it be lakes, streams, bogs, or swamps (Hefl et al. 2002).  NatureServe (2004 and in cit.) indicates that dense understory forests near water are preferred.\r\n\r\nIn northern California and western range north of there, it is associated with humid, dense, and mature conifer and hardwood-conifer forests (CA WHR, downloaded 07/10/2003).  In Idaho, it occupies cedar-hemlock forests.  South of northern Colorado, its habitat is more concentrated in riparian areas (Hefl et al. 2002).  In Alaska, it uses spruce-fir, grassy cliffs, and other environments (Hefl et al. 2002).  \r\n\r\nIn the northwest, forests patches >20ha have the highest Winter Wren breeding densities.  A study in Wisconsin did not find nests in narrow, linear forest patches that were <100 ha.  However, the species did not show a strong avoidance to edges; nests were found within 50m of forest edges (Hefl et al. 2002).  Partners in Flight management recommendations include retaining forest blocks >30 ha (Hefl et al. 2002). \r\n\r\nIn the eastern U.S., Winter Wrens nest locally in dense shrubby understory of northern hardwood and spruce-fir forests, in early successional communities, and in heath balds (Alsop 1991, Simpson 1992), often near water (Kaufman 1996).  \r\n\r\nWinter Wrens forage on the ground and low in vegetation.  It will also take food items from the surface of water (Kaufman 1996), immersing entire head in the process (Ehrlich et al. 1988).  An important habitat feature may be the presence of decaying stumps, downed logs, and upturned roots, which are used for nesting and foraging (Bent 1948).  They nest in any type of cavity or crevice, usually less than 6 feet from the ground, including crevices in the roots of upturned logs, holes in stumps, old woodpecker holes, rock crevices, holes in streambanks, or spaces under cabin porches. \r\n\r\nA study in coastal British Columbia found nests were always within 8m of water and half of the nests discovered were within 5m of water (Hefl et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nWinter wrens are fairly common in the high elevations of eastern mountains (Alsop 1991).\r\nBISON (03/2002) indicates that winter wrens can be found from 850 m to a maximum of 2750 m (in Colorado); this height is linked to the elevation of habitats utilized by this species.  It breeds up to 3718 m in the Sierra Nevadas (Hefl et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nWinter habitat associations are more general than breeding associations.  Any type of woodland is suitable.  Along the California coast, they prefer deciduous riparian forest and avoid dense Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) forest. In Utah, they use aspen (Populus spp.), scrub oak-mountain mahogany (Quercus sp.- Cercocarpus sp.), coniferous forest, spruce-fir, pi\u00f1on-juniper (Pinus sp.- Juniperus sp.), and urban areas.  They are present in mixed mesophytic and deciduous forests of the East but not those with a coniferous element (Hefl et al. 2002).  N.
