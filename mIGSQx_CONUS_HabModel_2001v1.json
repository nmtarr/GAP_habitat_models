These meadows are surrounded by ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir forests and contain numerous plant species as forage including forbs, lupines, grasses, and flowers (Wilson and Ruff 1999, USFWS 2003). They avoid meadows with high densities of small trees (Yensen and Sherman 1997). They create burrows under logs, rocks, and downed material throughout well-drained soils greater than 1 meter in depth (Yensen et al. 1991, Yensen and Sherman 1997, Wilson and Ruff 1999). Fire is an important component of habitat in order to prevent forest encroachment in meadow grasslands and is a major factor in the species' decline (Burns and Zbrorowski 1996, Yensen and Sherman 1997, Wilson and Ruff 1999, USFWS 2003).\r\nThe southern subspecies (S. b. endemicus) of Idaho ground squirrel is likely more numerous than its endangered northern counterpart and is patchily distributed among low rolling foothills at elevations between 670-975 meters (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Orignally, habitats consisted of sagebrush and native bunchgrass rangelands but have been converted to annual cheatgrass and medusahead grasslands (Wilson and Ruff 1999).\r\n\r\nsee Model Comments for hand modeling notes.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mIGSQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB05030", "scientific_name": "Urocitellus brunneus", "ITIS_TSN": "930316", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100453", "common_name": "Idaho Ground Squirrel"}}
