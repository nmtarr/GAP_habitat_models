It occurs in the Peloncillo Mountains of New Mexico and areas further south.  The Peloncillo Mountains are vegetated with Madrean evergreen woodland, brushy chaparral and stunted pinyon-pine juniper forests (Eaton 1992, Schemnitz and Zeedyk 1992).  \r\n\r\nMexican Turkey habitat within the U.S. is vegetated with border pinyon-Tourney oak-bull muhly savanna, emory oak-bear grass-side oats grama steppe, Tourney oak-manzanita chaparral, Emory oak-canyon grape, Arizona white oak (Quercus arizonica)-bull muhly, Chihuahua pine (Pinus leiophylla)-silverleaf oak (Quercus hypoleucoides), and pinyon-pinyon rice grass (Piptochaetium fimbriatum) communities (Schemnitz and Zeedyk 1992).  York and Schemnitz (2003) radio-tracked individuals to determine their habitat associations throughout the year.  In the summer and spring, the turkeys used pinyon-juniper woodlands that included pinyon ricegrass.  They also used 3 riparian habitat types: canyon bottoms with Chihuahua pines and an understory of silverleaf oak, riparian habitat dominated by Arizona oak and bull muhly grass, and riparian habitat with abundant large Emory oaks and an understory of canyon grape (Vitis arizonica).  \r\n\r\nDuring the winter, they used pinyon-juniper woodlands, the Tourney oak dominated riparian habitat type, open savannas with a canopy of pinyon-juniper, Toumey oak (Quercus toumeyi) and a dense layer of bull muhly grass (Muhlenbergia emersley), and open woodlands dominated by large Emory oaks (Quercus emoryi) and scattered bear-grass (Nolina microcarpa) over a grassy ground cover of sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula).  The riparian habitats dominated by Arizona oak (Quercus arizonica) and large Emory oaks that were used during spring and summer were avoided during winter.  They also avoided grassland habitats dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and sideoats grama and dense shrub habitat dominated by Toumey oak and manzanita (Arctostaphylos pungens).  \r\n\r\nN.
