Outside of coastal plain individuals are often found along the margins of streams or in the vicinity of ditches, vernal ponds and bogs that are fed by seepages or springs.  They are especially common in forested floodplains, where they spend daylight hours under logs, in burrows, or in piles of damp debris deposited by floods (Mount 1975).  Under mesic conditions, they can be found some distance from water (Martof et al. 1980). This salamander is common in the piedmont and coastal plain, and moderately common but restricted to larger valley areas in the mountains (Martof et al. 1980).  They are primarily found below 800 m in elevations, but some populations occur sporadically in the southern Appalachians up to 1000 m. Egg deposition occurs in late fall or early winter.  They lay several dozen eggs singly or in small clusters in underground crevices associated with springs, temporary pools, and streams.  The larvae are aquatic and hatch in 6-8 weeks.  Metamorphosis occurs several months.  They are sexually mature in 1-2 years.
