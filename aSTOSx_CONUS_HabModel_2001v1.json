Southern torrent salamanders have been reported to be associated with headwater habitats in late-seral forests in California (Welsh and Lind 1996). However, other studies have presented significant bioregional differences as they found no relationship with seral stage in populations studied in coastal redwood commercial timberlands (Diller and Wallace 1996). It is important to notice that it has been well established that southern torrent salamanders are sensitive to timber harvest (Corn and Bury 1989; Bury et al. 1991; Welsh and Lind 1996; Lannoo 2005; Green et al. 2013). \r\n\r\nEgg deposition sites include a report of mid-channel boulder in a first-order stream in Humboldt County, California where cobble was the main substrate near the nest. Other reports include boulders in coastal streams, and beneath boulders. \r\n\r\nLarvae of southern torrent salamanders have been reported to be adapted to mountain brook microenvironments, also used by adults (Valentine and Dennis 1964; Lannoo 2005), which are characterized by slow-moving flows, shallow waters of springs, headwater streams, seeps, cold (6.5-15 0C), with unsorted rock, usually in mesic, mature forests (Welsh and Lind 1996).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSTOSx", "ELCode": "AAAAJ01020", "scientific_name": "Rhyacotriton variegatus", "ITIS_TSN": "550252", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104649", "common_name": "Southern Torrent Salamander"}}
