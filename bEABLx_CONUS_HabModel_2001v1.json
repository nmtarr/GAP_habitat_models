They forage in short sparse vegetation (Nicholson 1997) and require a nesting cavity located away from other overhanging trees (Alsop 1991).  Cavities may include old woodpecker holes, birdhouses (Harrison 1975), mailboxes, or holes in fence posts (Potter et al. 1980, Alsop 1991).  These requirements can be found in a variety of semi-open habitats with scattered coniferous or deciduous trees whether they be riparian or upland, although Eastern Bluebirds are most commonly found in pine-oak woodlands (Gowaty and Plissner 1998).  Suitable land covers include farms, roadsides, orchards, burned areas, forest clearings, forest edges, open pine woods, clear-cuts in oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) forests, burned tracts of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) plains and longleaf pine\u2013slash pine (P. palustris\u2013P. caribaea) woods, 2 to 4 year old pine plantations, fire-maintained savannas, suburbs, swamps, lawns, and golf courses (Harrison 1975, Kaufman 1996, Nicholson 1997, Gowaty and Plissner 1998).  They are found in Colorado in cottonwoods along streams and in the edges of ponderosa pine forests up to 2,440 m elevation (Kingery, 1998).  In Arizona in summer, the best observed habitat is open, grassy pine-oak woods (Marshall, 1957).  In Arizona, is a rare and local resident in the live oaks and nearby pines from the Huachuca mountains west to beyond Nogales; rare or casual in winter in Tucson.  They can be found in southeastern Arizona in the Chiricahua Mountains in oak-juniper woodland, with major species Juniperus deppeana, Pinus leiophylla, Quercus emoryi, Quercus arizonica, and Pinus cembroides (Phillips et al., 1964).  They are absent on the barrier islands of North Carolina (Fussell and Lyons 1990).\r\n\r\nIn winter, Eastern Bluebirds prefers open forests, forest edges, pastures, orchards, and parklands (Gotawy and Plissner 1998).  They will also forage in closed canopy deciduous forest with sparse understory (Gowaty and Plissner 1998).  N.
