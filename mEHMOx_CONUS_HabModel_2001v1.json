It can be found in upland fields and meadows, open forest, forest clearings, tangled patches of briar or blackberry, roadside ditches, and in wet bottomlands and grassy flats (Stalling 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Old fields with tall grasses, such as broom sedge, are preferred (Brown 1997). This species is rare to locally common within early and mid-successional habitats in the Southeast at elevations below 2000 feet [609m] (Hall 1981, Stalling 1997). They have been found in briar patches, brackish meadows, and wet bottomlands, and marshlands and seldom if ever in forested habitats (Wilson and Ruff 1999, Trani et al. 2007). They can occur in regenerating pine stands <8 years old and plantations < 14 years old (Mengak et al. 1989).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, the eastern harvest mouse is found mainly in grass and herbaceous dominated environments of early successional habitats such as abandoned fields, weedy ditches, and briar thickets. They construct nests of shredded grass and plant fibers on the ground among tangled thickets (Schmidly 2004). In north-central Oklahoma, this species has been captured in tallgrass prairie similar to those found in Texas (Thies et al. 1993, Stalling 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mEHMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF02020", "scientific_name": "Reithrodontomys humulis", "ITIS_TSN": "180342", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106137", "common_name": "Eastern Harvest Mouse"}}
