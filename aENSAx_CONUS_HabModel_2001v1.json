Considered a ring species, the populations in the central valley of California are arranged parapatrically in a ring (Stebbins 1985); Monterey salamanders (coastal) and large-blotched salamanders (inland) co-occur in four sites in California and show little to no hybridization (Wake et al. 1986). A second ring is conformed in the Sierra Nevada allowing for yellow-eyed salamanders and Sierra Nevada salamanders to hybridize (Wake et al. 1989).\r\nThis species is usually associated with canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis), but negatively correlated with blue oak (Q. douglassi; Block and Morrison 1998). It has been reported that in the Douglas fir forests of northern California, salamanders are more abundant in old-growth stands than mature or young stands (Bury 1983). However, in Oregon and Washington, there was no reported correlation with salamander density and stand age; In some cases, salamanders were more abundant in drier sites (Aubry et al. 1988).\r\nAn important observation by Stebbins (1951) supports the idea that edge habitats result the most favorable to ensatinas. Habitat includes coniferous forest, oak woodland, deciduous forest, chaparral, and coastal sage scrub (Stebbins 1951). Cover in these habitat is provided by microclimatic conditions under logs, moss, and bark (Welsh and Lind 1991), talus (Herrington 1988), leaf litter (Corn and Bury 1991), and animal burrows (Storer 1925; Lannoo 2005; Green et al. 2013).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aENSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD04010", "scientific_name": "Ensatina eschscholtzii", "ITIS_TSN": "173732", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105136", "common_name": "Ensatina"}}
