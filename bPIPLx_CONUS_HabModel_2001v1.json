Piping Plovers forage on sparsely vegetated sand, mud, or gravel shorelines within 5m of water's edge (Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004).  They place their nests in shallow scrapes in areas such as sparsely vegetated mudflats, and islands of shallow lakes, ponds, rivers, impoundments, and reservoirs, wide sand or gravel beaches (< 20 m) with highly clumped vegetation and less than 5 percent overall vegetative cover, and sandflats along barrier islands (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998, NatureServe, Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004). \r\n\r\nThe Northern Great Plains population of Piping Plovers primarily inhabits alkali wetlands and large prairie river habitats.  These habitats include alkali lakes, reservoirs, river beaches, sandflats, dredge islands, sparsely vegetated, windswept and sandy or gravelly islands, beaches, and peninsulas of inland lakes drained river floodplains, freshwater lakes, dry alkali lakes, sandpits, industrial ponds, gravel mines, and washed-out hillside beaches on small semi-permanent alkali wetlands.  Nests are placed in wide, gravelly, salt-encrusted beaches with minimal vegetation (USFWS 2010).  They prefer wide, sparsely vegetated sand or gravel beaches adjacent to vast alkali lakes and may prefer beaches containing gravel over those that do not (Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004).  \r\n\r\nGreat Lakes populations use sparsely vegetated open sand, gravel, or cobble pans and sand spits of glacially-formed sand dune ecosystems along Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron.    They frequently nest adjacent to dunes and prefer areas where the vegetative cover is less than 20% (Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004).  They place nests on sand spits or sand beaches associated with wide, unforested systems of dunes and swales on in the flat pans behind primary dunes along Lake Michigan (USFWS 2003).  In Michigan, they only placed nests more than 34 m from a forest edge (USFWS 2003).  They will also nest in rangelands and pastures in mid to short-grass prairies next to suitable water bodies (Andrews and Righter 1992, Haig 1992, Kingery 1998, NatureServe).  \r\n\r\nAtlantic populations nest along barrier island beaches, ocean fronts, bays, sand bars, shorelines of coastal ponds, lagoons, spoil islands, tidal creeks and marshes, peninsulas, reservoirs, brackish lakes, rivers, and industrial ponds from Maine south to North Carolina (Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004).\r\n\r\nThe Piping Plover occurs in the Southwest Regional GAP area only in a few remote areas on the Great Plains in Colorado and New Mexico.  \r\n\r\nBoth subspecies winter along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts south of Virginia on accreting ends of barrier islands, sandy peninsulas, beaches, mudflats, sandflats, algal flats in bays, salt marshes, coastal lagoons, barrier island washover areas, oyster reefs, gravel shores, and spoil islands (USFWS 1996, Elliott-Smith and Haig 2004). \r\n\r\nN.
