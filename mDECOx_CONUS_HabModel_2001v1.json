It has also been reported from vegetated urban areas, agricultural lands, and barren areas (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). It usually lives in desert grasslands (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992). Desert cottontails are found from pinon-juniper woodland down through desert and grassland habitats (Findley 1987). They occur on grasslands on eastern plains, especially in prairie dog colonies where burrows provide excellent cover (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species inhabits a variety of other situtations including montane shrublands, riparian lands, semidesert shrublands and various woodland-edge habitats in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The range of audobonii is within the lower Sonoran Life zone and lower part of the Upper Sonoran Life zone (Hall 1995). The desert cottontail in Arizona lives primarily in the desert scrub, including the Great Basin Desertscrub and the plains-desert grasslands (Hoffmeister 1986). The home range is 0.4ha for females to over 6ha for males (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). The elevational range is from below sea level in California to 2,134m in Arizona (Chapman and Willner 1978, Hoffmeister 1986). The lethal body temperature is 44.8 degrees C (Chapman and Willner 1978). L. audubonii occurs throughout Arizona at elevations generally below the coniferous forests (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in eastern Colorado into the foothills of the front range and in western Colorado below 2,135m (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is present in southern Nevada (Hall 1995). The species occurs statewide in New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It is present in western, eastern, and northeastern Utah (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). In California, this species \"inhabits most of the southern two-thirds of the state, excluding the higher elevations. Range extends north into the Sacramento Valley and surrounding foothills (Chapman and Willner 1978). Abundant to common in grasslands, open forests, and desert shrub habitats (Hall 1946, Ingles 1965). Found in more open habitats than brush rabbits.\" (quoted from CA WHR [Polite et al. 2007] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, the desert cottontail frequents brushy areas with short vegetation within grasslands, creosote brush, and cactus deserts. In the Trans-Pecos, catclaw thickets, mesquite, allthorn, and various other desert shrubs and short grass habitats are preferred. This species utilizes prairie dog towns and their excavations for burrowing and hiding especially in the plains regions (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mDECOx", "ELCode": "AMAEB01070", "scientific_name": "Sylvilagus audubonii", "ITIS_TSN": "180122", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103423", "common_name": "Desert Cottontail"}}
