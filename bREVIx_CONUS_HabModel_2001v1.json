This vireo is a long distance migrant, which winters in the northern parts of South America (Cimprich et al. 2000). The Red-Eyed Vireo\u2019s breeding range extends as far into the southwest as the eastern plains of Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998, Cimprich et al. 2000). During migration, the Red-Eyed Vireo is an uncommon to common migrant in New Mexico and Colorado, elsewhere there are a few accidental records (not mapped) in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.  It occurs as an accidental to uncommon migrant throughout these states (Phillips et. al. 1964, Hayward et al. 1976, Ryser 1985, Andrews and Righter 1992, Cimprich et al. 2000, BISON-M). \r\n\r\nRed-eyed Vireos breed in deciduous and mixed deciduous-coniferous forests throughout their summer range in upland and bottomland environments, except in those with no understory.  They typically breed in mature (Fussell 1994) or second growth (Nicholson 1997), wet or dry (Potter et al. 1980), deciduous or mixed open woods with an undergrowth of saplings. In addition, Red-eyed Vireos will also commonly occur in forest clearings, burned areas, wooded edges of streams (Kaufman 1996), orchards, cemeteries, (NatureServe 2005) and residential areas where large trees grow (Cimprich et al 2000, GA-GAP 2003).  In general this species tends to avoid coniferous forests (Nicholson 1997), and in pine-dominated landscapes of the Southeast, they can be found in riparian areas with deciduous trees.  In Louisiana, however, they are generally abundant in loblolly-shortleaf pine-upland hardwood forests (Barry et al. 1995).  They often breed in alder (Alnus) thickets and aspen (Populus) groves in the northern portion of the U.S. (Cimprich et al. 2000).  In the southwest, particularly Colorado, the Red-Eyed Vireo breeds in the riparian corridors of the Platte and Arkansas rivers (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998). These river habitats provide lowland riparian forests with mature cottonwoods (Populus spp.) needed for nesting and foraging on insects (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998).  They have also been known to breed in urban areas along the Front Range in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Breeding territory sizes range between 0.8-1.7 ha (Kingery 1998).\r\n\r\nRed-eyed Vireos are moderately sensitive to forest patch size, but can be found in forest fragments as small as 0.5 ha (Herkert et al. 1993, Cimprich et al. 2000).  They are more abundant in forest interiors than at edges but also have an affinity for small canopy openings within forests (Cimprich et al. 2000).  \r\n\r\nDuring migration, the Red-Eyed Vireo will utilize a wider variety of forested habitats but still prefers deciduous woodlands compared to coniferous woodlands (Cimprich et al. 2000).  In migration, this vireo will inhabit lowland riparian areas along streams, forest edges, suburban areas, parks, or any area relatively open with scattered trees (Hayward et al. 1976, Andrews and Righter 1992, Cimprich et al. 2000). \r\n\r\nThe Colorado Wildlife Species Database (Schrupp and Cade 1989) and the Biota Information System of New Mexico (BISON-M) reported an elevation range of 914 \u2013 2,130 m.  Cimprich et al. (2000) reported a max elevation of 2,000 m in the Rocky Mountains.  N.
