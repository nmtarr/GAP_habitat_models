It occupies areas of subdued relief associated with internal basins on sandy and/or fine detrital soils (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Primarily lives in bottomlands, in areas of loose sand or packed sandy soil amid low grass, saltbush, desert tea, and scattered yucca and mesquite (Stebbins 1985). Inhabits primarily plains grassland, flood plain habits of sandy river basins and the edges of desert playas (Stebbins 1985). Has been found in pinyon-juniper shrublands (Degenhardt et al. 1996). The species was observed several hundred meters away from the edge of Conchas Lake, and it occurred in small patches of juniper grassland interspersed with sandstone surfaces and among widely spaced mesquite trees in a sandy valley (Walker et al. 1992). The species is found along the tributaries of the Rio Grande (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Persons and Wright 1999, Stebbins 1985). It seems to prefer those areas that are flooded regularly and contain human evidence such as ditches, fences and trash piles (Christiansen et al. 1971, Persons and Wright 1999).  At a site at Conchas lake the soil was a mixture of sand, gravel, and rocks (Walker et al. 1992). It occurs at the Armendaris lava field on both lava and soiled sites, but was more numerous on soil-covered areas (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). C. neomexicanus occurs at elevations of 1,000-1,900m (Degenhardt et al. 1996).  The Conchas Lake population may have been introduced (Persons and Wright 1999). The only population in Arizona, at Petrified Forest National Park,  is introduced (Persons and Wright 1999). C. neomexicanus occurs in New Mexico at Conchas Lake and in the Rio Grande Valley from Rio Arriba County south into Texas and west through Hidalgo County (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Persons and Wright 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rNMWHx", "ELCode": "ARACJ02090", "scientific_name": "Aspidoscelis neomexicana", "ITIS_TSN": "174024", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103871", "common_name": "New Mexico Whiptail"}}
