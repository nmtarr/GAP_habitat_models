In Mexico, the distribution continues from Chihuahua to southern Sinaloa. Populations are also well established across Baja California. The elevational range is estimated from desert lowlands below sea level up to 2135 meters (Natureserve.org; Stebbins 2003). This species spends prolonged periods of inactivity burrowed in or using soil, leaf litter, and decaying logs.\r\n\r\nInhabits ecosystems that include desert, shrubland, chaparral, conifer woodland, and grassland. More specifically, habitats are characterized by creosote bush desert, mesquite prevalent washes, broken upland terrain, rocky areas of plains and lower slopes, succulent desert, mesas, sagebrush semidesert, chaparral, tobosa/grama grassland, and pinyon/juniper woodland. Also found in areas vegetated by ocotillo, agave, and yucca (Behler and King 1979; Degenhardt et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nSW\t-Common plant associations include yucca, ocotillo, agave, pinyon-juniper zones, mesquite, and grasses like tobosa and grama.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWPNSx", "ELCode": "ARADB30030", "scientific_name": "Salvadora hexalepis", "ITIS_TSN": "174271", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104762", "common_name": "Western Patch-nosed Snake"}}
