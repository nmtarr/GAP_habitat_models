Two very small populations currently inhabit southern Texas, while only several individuals have been recorded in recent years in Arizona (USFWS 2010).  The Texan populations inhabit remnant habitats, one on private ranches in Willacy and Kenedy Counties, and the other in eastern Cameron County on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge.  A radio-tracked female was documented spending time on Santa Ana NWR.\r\n\r\nOcelots occupy a diverse set of habitats within their range that includes tropical rainforest, pine forest, gallery forest, riparian forest, semi-deciduous forest, dry tropical forest, savanna, shrublands, and marshlands (USFWS 2010).  Texas populations occur in dense thornscrub at Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge.  The spatial distributions of ocelot populations are highly correlated with dense vegetation (USFWS 2010). The USFWS Recovery Plan (2010) states that Ocelots prefer >75% canopy cover with 95% shrub cover and avoid areas with <50% canopy cover. Dispersing individuals often travel corridors with thornscrub cover, such as resacas, rivers, irrigation canals, irrigation drains, shorelines, fencelines, and road verges (USFWS 2010).\r\n\r\nLittle is known about range and habitat associations in Arizona, but Sonoran Ocelots inhabit tropical and subtropical thornscrub and deciduous forests (USFWS 2010) and they are believed to have formerly occurred in southeastern Arizona as far north as Fort Verde (Cockrum 1960). Although some researchers believe Ocelots continue to inhabit Arizona (Guggisberg 1975), this species is probably extirpated in Arizona save for a occasional dispersal from Mexican populations (Anon. 1982; USDI 1982; Tewes and Schmidly 1987). There were only four records of occurrence for the species in Arizona as of 1990 (USDI FWS 1990), but new evidence of Ocelots in Arizona has surfaced since then (USFWS 2010). Hoffmeister and Goodpaster (1954) list this species as \u201chypothetical\u201d in the Huachuca Mountains.  Repeated observations and inquiries produced no evidence of this species in the Huachucas; however, it this species does occur in southeastern Arizona, the Huachucas would be a likely place (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954).
