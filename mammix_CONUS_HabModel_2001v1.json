swamps, and marshes (USFWS 1978). They generally avoid beachs due to low prey availability (Lariviere 1999). Mink favors forested, permanent or semipermanent wetlands with abundant cover, marshes, and riparian zones (NatureServe 2005) and will also inhabit swamps, and  freshwater, brackish or coastal salt marshes (Humphrey 1982, Layne 1984).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe mink ranges throughout most of North America north of Mexico except for Arizona (NatureServe). Although mink can be found in a variety of habitats, they are obligate riparian animals, never found far from permanent streams, wetlands, or other surface water (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Mink use of variety of habitats including temperate and boreal forests, prairies, freshwater and saltwater coastal areas, and tundra; limiting factor is availability of water and food (Feldhamer et al. 2003). More abundant along creek and river logjams, overhanging banks, and grassy or bushy banks were prey hide (Feldhamer et al. 2003). Usually associate with water, although species can be found in xeric habitats if food is abundant (Lariviere 1999). In prairie environments, mink activity is most frequent on large wetlands with irregular shorelines and large areas of open water (Feldhamer et al. 2003, Lariviere 1999). In New Mexico, mink are found along permanent watercourses in and near the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, perhaps the Rio Grande Valley, and along the upper San Juan- Animas drainage in San Juan County (Findley et al. 1975). In Utah, occurs sparingly in the high Uinta and Wasatch mountains, southeast to La Sal Mountains; also reported in southern portion of state in Dixie and Fishlake National Forests (Durrant 1952). Provo River in Wasatch Mountains probably contains largest number of this semiaquatic mustelid (Durrant 1952). Mink inhabit lakes or streams; therefore have a restricted range in Nevada (Hall 1995). A number of specific factors affect the presence and density of mink; availability of den sites such as beaver lodges and muskrat dens are important, aquatic vegetation such as willows and emergent vegetation; also crayfish abundance (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Male home range considerably larger than that of female; average for female 20-50 acres and for males 1900 acres plus, up to 8 km (5 mi.) in diameter (NatureServe). Mink are excellent swimmers and make their dens in holes in the ground, under logs, or in crevices in rocks (Hall 1995). Mink commonly feed on fish, and are largely nocturnal (Hall 1995). Feeds on small mammals, other vertebrates (e.g., waterfowl), crayfish, and small vertebrates associated with aquatic/riparian ecosystems (NatureServe). Muskrats particularly are favored in some areas, but diet reflects availability (NatureServe). An individual was collected at 1,440m in Utah (Durrant 1952). In Colorado, found from 914-4,420m (CWSD). In California, the mink ocurrs in the northern half of the state (Grinnel et al. 1937) and inhabits most aquatic habitats including some coastal areas. It forages along streams, rivers, lakes, ponds and marshes, occasionally pursuing prey underwater. They occurr in northern California up to approximately 2700m (Ahlborn et al. from Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxanomic": {"gap_code": "mAMMIx", "ELCode": "AMAJF02050", "scientific_name": "Mustela vison", "ITIS_TSN": "726284", "Global_SEQ_ID": "791856", "common_name": "American Mink"}, "input_layers": {"intEdgeEcoWidth": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strAvoid": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strForIntBuffer": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intIntoBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intElevMax": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "PrimEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "AuxEcoSys": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intIntoBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnUrbanExclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intElevMin": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "Region": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnUrbanInclude": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strUseForInt": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffWV": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strStreamVel": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strEdgeType": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "strSalinity": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "ysnHydroFW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5", "intFromBuffOW": "https://doi.org/10.5066/F7959GF5"}}
