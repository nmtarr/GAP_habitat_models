This species is denominated as terrestrial regardless of its ability to swim, it also burrows in or using soil, fallen logs, and ground litter. Logs, stumps, animal burrows, and thickets represent surface cover opportunities (Natureserve.org). Its palustrine habitat includes forested, herbaceous, and scrub-shrub wetlands. It also occurs in cropland, conifer forest, hardwood forest, grassland, savanna, conifer, hardwood, and mixed woodland.\r\n\r\nPopulations are well established in habitats such as wet prairies, wet savannas, pastures, swamps, hardwood floodplains, sandhills, hilly second-growth forest, edges of cypress ponds, palmetto-pine flatwoods, scrub pinewoods. Also along canals used for rice field irrigation, roadside ditches, areas surrounding lakes, marshes, and moist or wet lowlands (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Werler and Dixon 2000). Proximity of its distribution to human settlements has resulted in habitat destruction, and automobile-caused mortality, but also exacerbating the effects of raptors, snakes, and carnivore mammal-caused mortality (Ernst 1992).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Palmetto-pine flatwoods, scrub pinewood, conifer forest, hardwood forest, grassland, savanna, woodland,  herbaceous, scrub-shrub wetlands.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rPRATx", "ELCode": "ARADE03020", "scientific_name": "Sistrurus miliarius", "ITIS_TSN": "174302", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106160", "common_name": "Pygmy Rattlesnake"}}
