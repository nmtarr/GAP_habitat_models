From there, it extends south into Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Virginia, central Ohio, eastern West Virginia, Illinois, Indiana, northeast Missouri. Also found in western Wisconsin, South Dakota, and northeastern Iowa (Kiesow 2006). Smaller populations occur in Minnesota and Wisconsin. \r\nTo further separate the range of Cope\u2019s gray treefrog that of the gray treefrog, it has been reported H. versicolor has a southwestern group from east central Texas extending north through central and eastern Oklahoma, western Arkansas, eastern Kansas, and southwestern Missouri. \r\nAlso, an eastern and northern group from south New Jersey, central Missouri, along the Appalachian Mountains, extending only as far south into Georgia and Alabama (Ralin and Selander 1979 in Lannoo 2005; Weller 2002).\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the gray treefrog (H. versicolor) expands into areas where Cope\u2019s gray treefrog (H. chrysoscelis) occur and include south-central Virginia, Maryland, southern Ohio, and broadly from eastern Kansas to east Texas, but also sympatry has been reported in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota (Dodd 2013).\r\nNot described to utilize the ground or even the edges of water, but possibly only during breeding. Foraging mainly occurs in shrubs and in trees that are found nearby shallow water (Conant and Collins 1998).\r\n\r\nSadults are found sometimes in trees or in mossy and lichen covered fences, and abandoned bird houses; known to use Chinese tallowtrees (Triadica sebifera), an introduced tree species (Lannoo 2005). Other plant associations include sedges (Carex sp.), false nettle (Boehmeria cylindrical), reed grass (Phalaris arundinacea), and swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor) saplings (Roble 1979 in Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGYTRx", "ELCode": "AAABC02130", "scientific_name": "Hyla versicolor", "ITIS_TSN": "173503", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102087", "common_name": "Gray Treefrog"}}
