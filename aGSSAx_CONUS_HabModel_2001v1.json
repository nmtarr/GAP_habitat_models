Localities include San Gorgonio Pass, the margins of Colorado Desert, south Cabazon, Snow Creek Canyon, within the city of Palm Springs. (Wake and Jockusch 2000). This species also occurs in Santa Catalina, North, Middle, and South Coronados, and Todos Santos Islands, and have been successfully introduced to Hanford, Kings County, in the San Joaquin Valley of Central California (Jockusch 1996). \r\nThey occur at an elevational range from sea level to 1500m in Mt. Palomar in San Diego County, while most localities are found below 700m (Green et al. 2013).\r\nHistorically, garden slender salamanders occupied habitat that included coastal sage scrub, chaparral, coast live oak woodlands (Lannoo 2005; Stebbins 1951), and foothills and alluvial fans (Schoenherr 1976). In San Diego County, habitat of preference is oak woodland and chaparral. Currently, this species is associated with irrigated landscapes in urban settings (Cunninham 1960; Cornett 1981). At the southern edge, this species has been reported under decaying desert agave in a desert site characterized by cardon cactus, several opuntia species, and boojum tree (Grismer 1982). \r\nOn Santa Catalina Island, this species occurs in coastal sage scrub (Schoenherr et al. 1999). While in Todos Santos Island, north of Baja California, individuals were reported under rocks on a north-facing slope (Zweifel 1958). The introduction to San Joaquin Valley is due to confinement of the species to ornamental trees and shrubs in residential gardens that are usually irrigated daily (Lannoo 2005). \r\n\r\nAt the southern edge, this species has been reported under decaying desert agave in a desert site characterized by cardon cactus, several opuntia species, and boojum tree (Grismer 1982).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGSSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD02040", "scientific_name": "Batrachoseps major", "ITIS_TSN": "208343", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103750", "common_name": "Garden Slender Salamander"}}
