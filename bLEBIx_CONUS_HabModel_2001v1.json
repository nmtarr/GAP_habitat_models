It winters in parts of Texas, Florida, and the lower Colorado River (Gibbs et al. 1992).  The lower Colorado River Valley, Bosque del Apache Wildlife Refuge, Salton Sea, Picacho Reservoirs are known breeding locations in the Southwest (Davis 1997).  Least Bitterns also breed in dense, cattail marshes along the lower Colorado River, Salt and Gila Rivers, Picacho Reservoir, Dankworth Ponds, Tayasci Marsh, and in Yavapai Co., Arizona (NMDGF 2000) and rarely at a few scattered locations in Utah.\r\n\r\nLeast Bitterns inhabit wetlands along large rivers, lakes, and estuaries at low elevations (Poole et al. 2009).  They prefer either freshwater or brackish marshes that contain dense patches of tall aquatic or semi aquatic vegetation, such as Typha, Carex, Scirpus, Sagittaria, or Myriscus, interspersed with patches of woody vegetation and deep, open water, but they will also occasionally use salt marshes and mangrove swamps (Poole et al. 2009).  Habitat types used by the species also include bogs and swamps with dense cattails, reeds, buttonbush, bulrushes, sawgrass, smartweeds, arrowheads, and other tall vegetation.  They prefer marshes with scattered bushes or other woody growth (DeGraff and Rappole 1995, Utah Conservation Data center 2003).  In the northern portion of the breeding range, they have a strong association with cattails but this may merely be a result of the fact that cattail is the most common tall wetland plant in suitable habitats (Poole et al. 2009).\r\n\r\nPoole et al. (2009) reported the following breeding habitat preferences for different states:\r\n\u2022\tIn Iowa, they were most abundant in freshwater marshes at times when equal amounts of open water and emergent vegetation were available.\r\n\u2022\tWithin a large marsh in Wisconsin, Least Bitterns were only found in cattails (in deep or shallow water) and not dry areas with cattails (Typha), river bulrush (Scirpus fluviatilis), and sedge (Carex spp.). \r\n\u2022\tIn Maine, they can be found among dense, tall stands of cattail, such as those in managed impoundments and coves on lakes, and they sometimes inhabit sedgy bogs. \r\n\u2022\tResearch in Missouri found them to be associated with dense vegetation adjacent to open water but not in open, sparse, or short vegetative cover or muddy openings.\r\n\u2022\tIn the Chesapeake Bay, they were found to be abundant in cattail marshes and weak-stemmed brackish marshes but uncommon in salt marshes. \r\n\u2022\tIn New York, they were associated with tall, dense patches of bulrush and cattail and deeper water depths in tidal marshes. \r\n\u2022\tIn the Florida Everglades, they were found in mixed sawgrass-cattail areas, homogeneous sawgrass, and homogeneous cattail and were detected twice as often in dense areas as in sparse areas.  They were also found in sloughs, rush prairies, mats of emergent vegetation, and burn areas, albeit infrequently.\r\n\u2022\tIn northwestern Tennessee, Least Bitterns were historically most abundant on lakes with emergent giant cutgrass (Zizaniopsis miliacea) and scarce in areas with swamp loosestrife and emergent trees.\r\n\u2022\tIn western New York State, nests were found from 0 to 57 m from water (mean = 3.5 m, SE = 0.8).\r\n\r\nThis species may be area sensitive as they are most regularly found in Iowa on wetlands > 5 ha. However, they have been reported on wetlands as small as 0.4 ha in Maine (Poole et al. 2009).\r\n\r\nLittle is known about the winter habitat of the Least Bittern but occurrence records are mostly from brackish and saline swamps and marshes (Poole et al. 2009).
