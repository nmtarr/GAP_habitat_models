This species has been captured in association with Larrea-Ambrosia, Emplectocladus, and Atriplex-Hilaria communities (Hardy 1945) and creosote (Larrea)- palo verde (Cercidium), and Agave-ocotillo communities (Johnson and Armstrong 1987).  Historically in southern Nevada, this species was found from open desert to the yellow pine belt (Burt 1936).  In the Grand Canyon, this mouse occurred within (1) typical desert vegetation, which is uninfluenced by the river regime and is characterized by brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), cacti (Opuntia spp.), creosote (Larrea tridentata) and Mormon tea (Ephedra spp.) and (2) within the area delineated by the high water line characterized by Apache plume (Celtis reticulata), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and acacia (Acacia greggii; Ruffner et al. 1978).  West of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, this mouse was trapped in creosote desert characterized by Ichaenactis, Chorizanthe, Cryptantha, Phacelia, Eriogonum, Hilaria rigida, Oryzopsis hymenoides and Bromus rubens (n = 9; Bradley and Mauer 1973).  In the Virgin River Province, southwestern most portion of the state, Honeycutt et al. (1981) identified this species most often at lower elevations within creosote bush community characterized by Larrea tridentata, Ambrosia dumosa, Bromus rubens, Yucca brevifolia, Yucca spp., and Opuntia spp.  In the Saint George Basin, Utah, this species was trapped within Larrea-Ambrosia and Atriplex-Hilaria Associations (Hardy 1945).  Larrea-Franseria was characterized as creosote (Larrea tridentata), burrow-bush (Franseria dumosa), Krameria (Krameria glandulosa), wolfberry (Lycium andersonii), yellow aster (Aster carnosus) and various species of cacti (Opuntia spp. and Echinocereus spp.; Hardy 1945).  Atriplex-Hilaria was characterized by four-winged saltbrush (Atriplex canescens), clumps of grass (Hilaria rigida), Lycium andersonii, winter fat (Eurotia lanata) and cholla (Opuntia echinocarpa; Hardy 1945). \r\n\r\nBlack brush: This species has been captured in association with black brush (Coleogyne; Armstrong 1979b).  At Canyonlands National Park, Utah, this species was trapped at three different buttes (Johnson 1976, 1981).  Jug Butte, which contained the highest number of trapped individuals (n = 248) was characterized as open juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodland with large areas of slick rock on the southwestern 2/3 of the butte with shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) \u2013 blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) community on the northeastern 1/3 (Johnson 1976, 1981).\r\n\r\nSagebrush:  In the Virgin River Province, southwestern most portion of the state, Honeycutt et al. (1981) identified this species most often at lower elevations within sagebrush community characterized by Artemisia filifolia, Artemisia tridentata and Bouteloua gracilis, shadscale contained Atriplex canescens, Guitierrezia microcephala and Bromus tectorum.\r\n\r\nGrasslands:  Throughout its range, this mouse is identified as occurring within grasslands (Baker 1968).\r\n\r\nChaparral:  This species has been captured in association with montane shrublands and semidesert shrublands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).\r\n\r\nPinyon-juniper:  Throughout its range, this mouse is identified as occurring within pinyon-juniper-oak woodlands (Baker 1968).  This species has been captured in association with pinyon-juniper woodland (Deacon et al. 1964; Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  In New Mexico, it has been identified as occurring in pinyon-juniper woodlands exclusively among jumbles of rock at the foot of cliff faces (Findley et al. 1975).  In the Spring Mountains, Clark County, it was trapped in pinyon-juniper woodlands; once again, it seems to be \u201callied more closely to a rocky substrate than to any particular type of vegetation\u201d (Deacon et al. 1964).  At Canyonlands National Park, Utah, this species was trapped at three different buttes (Johnson 1976, 1981).  Jug Butte, which contained the highest number of trapped individuals (n = 248) was characterized as open juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodland with large areas of slick rock on the southwestern 2/3 of the butte with shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) \u2013 blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) community on the northeastern 1/3 (Johnson 1976, 1981).  Junction Butte (n = 15) was characterized by open juniper woodland with scattered small stands of mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus) and large areas of slick rock (Johnson 1976, 1981).  Island in the Sky mesa, which contained two study sites was characterized by open pinyon (Pinus edulis)- juniper woodland with large areas of slickrock and thin, poorly developed soils on the western 3/5 of the site and black brush on the remaining 2/5; the total number of trapped individuals at this butte were combined (n = 9; Johnson 1976, 1981).   In Manti-LaSal National Forest, Utah, trapping data indicates it was trapped most frequently within canyons with vegetation characterized as pinyon-juniper (65/275; Sureda and Morrison 1999). \r\n\r\nPonderosa Pine Forest:  Historically in southern Nevada, this species was found from open desert to the yellow pine belt (Burt 1936).\r\n\r\nMixed Conifer:  This species has been captured in association with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa)- fir (Abies)- aspen (Populus tremuloides; Burt 1934).  Deacon et al. (1964) identified this species within fir-pine forests.  In the Spring Mountains, Clark County, it was trapped in fir-pine forest; once again, it seems to be \u201callied more closely to a rocky substrate than to any particular type of vegetation\u201d (Deacon et al. 1964).  In a modeling effort conducted by Sureda and Morrison (1999) cthis species was corrected classified with mixed coniferous (58%) and riparian vegetation (75%).  Trapping data indicates it was trapped most frequently within canyons with vegetation characterized as mixed coniferous (31/250; Sureda and Morrison 1999). \r\n\r\nRiparian:  In a modeling effort conducted by Sureda and Morrison (1999) in Manti-LaSal National Forest, Utah this species was corrected classified with mixed coniferous (58%) and riparian vegetation (75%).  Trapping data indicates it was trapped most frequently within canyons with vegetation characterized as riparian (38/250; Sureda and Morrison 1999).\r\n\r\nVegetation Structure:  Anderson (1979b) suggests this mouse occurs in \u201cmore open situations.\u201d\r\nForaging ecology \u2013  In California and southern Nevada, they eat seeds, insect and green vegetation depending on seasonal availability (Bradley and Mauer 1973).\r\n\r\nElevational Range:  In Grand Canyon, Hoffmeister (1971) observed this species between 2500 to 8800 feet (758 \u2013 2667 meters) elevation.  This is the only elevational information available for the state.  Historically in southern Nevada, this species was found from 3200 to 10000 feet (970 \u2013 3030 meters) elevation (Burt 1936).  In Nevada, it occurs from the lowest elevations to 10,000 feet (3030 meters; Mount Charleston; Hall 1946).  West of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, this mouse was trapped at around 2500 feet (758 meters; n = 9; Bradley and Mauer 1973).  In the Kyle Canyon, Spring Mountains, Clark County, it was trapped up to 10,000 feet (3030 meters); however, it was most common between 8200 to 8400 feet elevation (2485-2545 meters) and was again observed at around 5,700 feet elevation (1727 meters; Deacon et al. 1964).  With the Deacon et al. (1964) study, there is no explanation as to whether sampling design, vegetation or both factored into the species absence between 5700 to 8200 feet elevation (1727 \u2013 2485 meters); thus, the reliability of these elevational estimates may be suspect.  The elevational range information provided by Burt (1936) encompasses all other elevational information for the state.  Because Burt (1936) provided statewide information for Nevada, it is considered representative.  The elevational range is from 970 to 3030 meters.  In Colorado, it is \u201cmost abundant\u201d below 7000 feet (2121 meters), but has occurred to 8000 feet (2424 meters) along the north rim of Black Canyon, Gunnison National Monument (Lechleitner 1969).  Armstrong (1972) suggests this species occurs to 8000 feet (2424 meters) elevation.  Because Armstrong (1972) provided a statewide elevational range, it is considered representative for the state.  Also, the information provided by Lechleitner (1969) fell within this range.  Thus, the elevational range is below 2424 meters.  In Utah, this species was documented to occur between 2800 to 7500 feet elevation (848 \u2013 2273 meters; n = 120; Durrant 1952).  Rickart (2001) provided a summary of elevational observations for this mouse for Utah mountain ranges; these include the Uinta Mountains (1525-2440 m), Wasatch (1585-2165 m), Aquarius Plateau (1980-2290 m), Markagunt Plateau (1680-1830 m), Fisherlake Plateau (1645-2275 m), Wasatch Range (1435-1950 m), Tushay Mountains (1860-1980 m), Prevant Range (183 m), Snake Range (1770-2350 m), Ruby Mountains (1860 m), Deep Creek Range (1615-1710 m), Deep Creek Range (1615-1710 m), Oquirrh Mountains (1975 m), Raft River Range (1295 m), Stanbury Mountains (1920 m), La Sal Mountains (1220-225 m) and Henry Mountains (1525-2745 m).  The elevational gradient for Utah Mountains was derived using the maximum and minimum values of the above elevational ranges, which was from 1220 to 2745 meters elevation (Rickart 2001).  Because the information from Durrant (1952) and Rickart (2001) both represent statewide elevational estimates, these values will be combined using EDR 3.  The state elevational range is from 848 to 2745 meters.  Because the available information represents the majority of this species range in the southwestern U.S., this information satisfies EDR 5.  Therefore, it is combined using EDR 3.  Because this species was observed as occurring in numerous desertscrub types, which contain rocky areas, and desertshrub will occur at the lowest elevations within the five-state area, the collective elevational range for this species range in the five-state SWREGAP project area is from sea level to 3030 meters.\r\n\r\nRange: In Arizona, this species is known to occur along the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers and north of these rivers as well as in southern Yuma County (Hoffmeister 1986).  \u201cIdeal habitat\u201d includes the Inner Gorge of the Grand Canyon, including buttes within the canyon, volcanic areas along the Arizona Strip, as well as Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly (Hoffmeister 1986).  This species is patchily distributed, and often what appears to be \u201csuitable habitat\u201d may not be occupied (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  In Arizona, this species has been documented at Fairbank, San Pedro River (n \u02dc 12) and in the Huachuca Mountains (n = 1; Allen 1895).  In Colorado, this species inhabits the canyonlands along the western border from the southern half of Moffat County to Montezuma County (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  It is identified as occurring in the drier, rocky areas on the western one-fifth of the state, extending northeastward to near Cross Mountain along the Yampa River in Moffat County, eastward to Glenwood Springs, Garfield County, and the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Montrose County and southeastward to Mesa Verde National Park, Montezuma County (Lechleitner 1969).  It has been identified at Colorado National Monument, Mesa County (Lechleitner 1969).  In Nevada, this species is distributed throughout the state (Hall 1946), where suitable habitat is present.  In New Mexico, it has been identified only within McKinley and San Juan Counties (Findley et al. 1975).  In the San Juan Valley, it has been identified at Pine River, west of Waterflow, south of Farmington and south of Blanco (Harris 1963).  In Utah, this species was trapped in Canyonlands National Park (Armstrong 1979; n = 271, Johnson 1976, 1981).  Goldman (1939) suggests the canyon mouse on the islands of Salt Lake should be considered a separate subspecies due to degree of isolation; he named this subspecies P.c. pergracilis.  Historically, this species was documented throughout most of Utah including Beaver, Boxelder, Daggett, Duchesne, Emery, Grand, Juab, Kane, Iron, Millard, San Juan, Sevier, Uintah, Washington, and Wayne Counties.  Kirkland (1981) suggested the canyon mouse used the Green River as a dispersal route to extend their range into northeastern most Utah within the southern extent of the Bridger Basin and the north slope of the Uintas Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn California, this species is found mostly in arid, rocky areas where P. crinitus constructs nests and burrows, but also utilizes desert and chapparal (with the exception of chamise-redshank chapparl), subalpine conifers, eastside pines, pinyon-juniper and Joshua tree habitats in elevations up to 3050 meters (Brylski et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990). Vegetation species had little influence on this species distribution and abundance in Utah (Egoscue 1964).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCNDEx", "ELCode": "AMAFF03090", "scientific_name": "Peromyscus crinitus", "ITIS_TSN": "180284", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102501", "common_name": "Canyon Deermouse"}}
