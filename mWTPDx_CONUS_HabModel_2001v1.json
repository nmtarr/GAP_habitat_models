Within white-tailed prairie dog colonies, shrub cover can range from 0% (Collins and Lichvar, 1986) to 29% (Orabona-Cervoski, 1991), but generally averages <10% (Tilestone and Lechleitner, 1966). Total plant cover ranges from 10 to 82%, with an average of 38%, and tends to be lowest on shrub-dominated sites (Tileston and Lechleitner, 1966; Orabona-Cervoski, 1991).
