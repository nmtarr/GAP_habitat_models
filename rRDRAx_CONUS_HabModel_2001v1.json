Populations have been reported from Pioneertown and Morongo Valley of San Bernardino County, southeastern Los Angeles County, in several islands in the Gulf of California (Angel de la Guarda, Pond, San Lorenzo del Sur, Danzante, Monserrate, San Marcos, and San Jose Islands), and also in Isla de Santa Margarita and Isla Cedros along the Pacific coast of Baja California (Campbell and Lamar 2004; Grismer 2002; Murphy et al. 1995). It is important to mention the range does not include the desert area of the Sierra de Juarez in northeastern Baja California del Norte. The elevational range extends from near sea level to about 1500 meters, but populations have commonly been found below 1200 meters (Campbell and Lamar 2004).\r\n\r\nIn southern California, populations are commonly found in the western foothills of the Coast Ranges and in dry rocky inland valleys (Ernst 1992; Ernst and Ernst 2003). The habitats occupied by the red diamond rattlesnake include desertscrub, thornscrub, pine-oak woodland, rocky areas of tropical deciduous forest, ocean shores, sand dunes, grassland, and even cultivated areas amongst rock outcrops (Campbell and Lamar 2004; Grismer 2002; Stebbins 2003). This is a species that has also been reported in association with bare rock, talus, scree, chaparral, woodland, and mesquite/cactus vegetated patches. In southern Baja California, this species is generally found nearby heavy brush with prevalent rocky outcrops, but also in more arid, poorly vegetated plains (Armstrong and Murphy 1979, as referenced by Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nIts habitat is threatened by residential and agricultural development in inland valleys of California and Baja California (Armstrong and Murphy 1979; Jennings and Hayes 1994, as referenced by Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nSW\t-Desert scrub, thornscrub, mesquite/cactus patches, pine-oak woodland, and tropical deciduous forest.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rRDRAx", "ELCode": "ARADE02090", "scientific_name": "Crotalus ruber", "ITIS_TSN": "174316", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100051", "common_name": "Red Diamond Rattlesnake"}}
