The area occupied by this species is characterized by creeks, low gradient streams, medium sized rivers, shallow water pools, springs, spring brook. Also, forested wetland, scrub/shrub wetland, herbaceous wetland, and other riparian habitats.  Wet prairies, lakes, and sloughs are also frequently occupied by the peninsula cooter (Natureserve.org).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rPCOOx", "ELCode": "ARAAD07060", "scientific_name": "Pseudemys peninsularis", "ITIS_TSN": "551765", "Global_SEQ_ID": "802959", "common_name": "Peninsula Cooter"}}
