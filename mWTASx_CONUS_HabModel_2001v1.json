It is most common in grassland and marginal pinyon-juniper woodland; it appears to prefer level, often sandy areas (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Habitats include low deserts, semidesert and montane shrublands, plateaus, and foothills; places with sparse vegetation and hard gravelly surfaces (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, NatureServe 2003, Cockrum 1960).  The species is also found in rocky situations and along roadsides (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Occasionally it inhabits lowland riparian areas (Cockrum 1960).  A. leucurus is found among sagebrush, marginal pinyon-juniper woodland, Joshua tree, greasewood, shadscale, catclaw acacia, Mojave yucca, creosotebush, blackbrush, rabbitbrush, winter-fat, buckbrush, alkali sacaton, brome, grama shortgrass, and galleta and ricegrass (Belk and Smith 1991, Davis and Schmidley 1994, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, NatureServe 2003).  It rarely comes in contact with agricultural crops because it lives in relatively unpopulated areas, but when it does it eats grain, alfalfa, grapes, and the seeds of melons and corn (Belk and Smith 1991). \r\nThe main food items of A. leucurus are seeds and fruits, including those from greasebush and cacti (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Common seeds eaten are from banana yucca, Joshua tree, Mojave yucca, blackbrush, catclaw acacia, Ephedra, Opuntia sp., and Prosopis juliflora (NatureServe 2003).  It also eats sunflower seeds, oats, wheat, and barley.  Plants often selected for green parts are Oenothera sp., Eriogonum sp., and Erodium cicutarum (NatureServe 2003).  A. leucurus needs succulent food in the diet to obtain water, though it cannot survive indefinately without free water (NatureServe 2003, Fitzgerald et al. 1994).\r\nIn one excavated burrow in a cut bank at the side of the road, the main burrow was in soft volcanic ash between two layers of \"hardpan\" (Zeveloff 1988).  It ran about six inches in from, and parallel to, the cut, and about three feet from the top of the bank (Zeveloff 1988).\r\nThe species has been recorded from 152-2,591m in Nevada (Hall 1995), but elevational limits were not specified.  \r\nWhen ambient temperatures were less than 10 degrees Celcius and animals were left in traps overnight they were found torpid or dead the next morning (NatureServe 2003).  At 20 degrees Celcius they could be roused from torpor (NatureServe 2003).  A. leucurus occurs across northern Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found in eastern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs throughout Nevada (Belk and Smith 1991, Hall 1995). It occurs in northwestern New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004).  A. leucurus is present throughout most of Utah (Zeveloff 1988, Utah GAP 1997). Can be found in the following mountain ranges: Sheep Range; Virginia Mountains; Fox Range; Sand Range; Pine Forest Range; Cambridge Hills; East Range; Hot Creek Range; Quinn Canyon Range; Cactus Range; Belted Range; Rhyolite Hills; Red Hills; Candelaria Hills; North Pahroc Range; Hiko Range.
