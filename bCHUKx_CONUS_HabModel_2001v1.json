The species requires at least 10% shrub cover to reduce predation risk (Larsen et al., 2007). Chukar will also use talus, scree, and other steep, rocky slopes for cover and as escape terrain (Alcorn and Richardson, 1951; Zeiner et al., 1990; Walter, 2002; Lee et al., 2003). Eight days after a fire, 2,000 chukars were documented within burned shrub/grassland (Christensen, 1970).\r\n\r\nIn summer, the species remains near water sources (Alcorn and Richardson, 1951; Lee et al., 2003)\r\n\r\nIt avoids dense pinyon-juniper (Christensen, 1970; Lee et al., 2003).\r\n\r\nChukars have been known to feed on singleleaf pinon, rabbitbrush, lupine, Poa spp., cottonwood, wheat, and corn (Alcorn and Richardson, 1951).\r\n\r\nElevations at which the species has been sighted range from below sea level in California to 3659 m in the White Mountains of California and Nevada (Christensen, 1996).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCHUKx", "ELCode": "ABNLC03010", "scientific_name": "Alectoris chukar", "ITIS_TSN": "175908", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100461", "common_name": "Chukar"}}
