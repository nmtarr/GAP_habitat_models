This species is completely aquatic and individuals have only been reported from spring outflows, in the gravel substrate, or under rocks or leaves. This species retreats to subterranean crannies during unfavorable conditions (Green et al. 2013).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aTXSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05080", "scientific_name": "Eurycea neotenes", "ITIS_TSN": "173694", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105042", "common_name": "Texas Salamander"}}
