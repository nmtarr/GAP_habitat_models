Also found north along the Mississippi and Illinois river valleys into Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. The six-lined racerunner is also found from southern South Dakota and southeast Wyoming, eastern Colorado and New Mexico to south Texas (Jones and Lovich 2009). In Colorado, it occurs at elevations below 1980m in the north and 2285m in the south. It inhabits plains grassland, sandhills, sandy or gravelly banks and floodplains of streams, open rocky areas at the base of mountains, and the grassy openings of Ponderosa pines in the foothills (Hammerson 1999).  Open grassland, shrublands, and pinon-juniper woodlands (Jones and Lovich 2009). Occupies open ground, sandy or gravelly banks, sparsely vegetated areas, and beach dunes (Mount 1975).Sandy or loamy soils. Mount (1975) reported soft soil or sawdust as preferred for egg laying.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSLRAx", "ELCode": "ARACJ02110", "scientific_name": "Aspidoscelis sexlineata", "ITIS_TSN": "174014", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102815", "common_name": "Six-lined Racerunner"}}
