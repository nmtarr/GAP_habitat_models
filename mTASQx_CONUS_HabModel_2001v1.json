It is frequently observed on large boulders and on tops of junipers and large shrubs (Anderson 1972).  It is virtually absent from level, sandy terrain or flat mesa tops (Anderson 1972).  It seems to prefer hard-surfaced, gravelly washes or rocky hill slopes and is nearly absent from level, sandy terrain (Texas Tech University 1997).  The presence of canyons, bare cliffs, and rocks, with which the species is always closely associated, seems to be the determining factor of its range within the Trans-Pecos (Anderson 1972).  A. interpres usually lives in burrows, but crevices in and among rocks may serve as den sites (Bailey 1971).  It prefers hard-surfaced gravelly or rocky hillslopes (Bailey 1971).  The species is found among low bushes, yucca, and prickly pear (Bailey 1971).  A. interpres eats the seeds of yucca, juniper, saltgrass, ripe fruits of prickly pear and cholla cactus, seeds of mesquite, sotol, creosote bush, and insects (Bailey 1971).  Records of occurrence showed elevations from 1,143-1,768m (Findley 1987), but an actual minimum or maximum was not indicated.  It occurs from 540-1830m in Trans-Pecos Texas (Best et al. 1990). The species occurs in New Mexico east of the Rio Grande to the Guadalupe Mountains and north to the Sandia Mountains in Sandoval County (Findley 1975, Frey 2004) and can be found in the following mountain ranges: Sandia Mountains; Guadalupe Mountains; Manzano Mountains; Organ Mountains; and San Andres Mountains.  -SWreGAP.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mTASQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB04030", "scientific_name": "Ammospermophilus interpres", "ITIS_TSN": "180180", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102058", "common_name": "Texas Antelope Squirrel"}}
