Populations also extend from Mexico to Guatemala (Rossman et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003; Webb 1980). Stebbins (2003) has reported the elevational range from near sea level locations up to 2700 meters in higher altitude establishments.\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and vegetative debris (Natureserve.org). In the arid and semiarid portions of the southwest, this species is sometimes found far from water into desert, woodland, shrubland, and grassland, but primarily confined to nearby areas of permanent water sources (Jones 1990).  Other habitats include dry grassland, rocky hillsides, canyons, foothills, mountains, limestone ledges, wooded ravines, cedar brakes, desert flats, tropical lowlands, pine-oak forest, and even cloud forest. Riparian habitats include spring seepages, intermittent and permanent streams, irrigation ditches, among other water bodies (Stebbins 2003; Tennant 1984). In Mexico, populations occur in tropical barrancas, tropical deciduous forest, thorny scrub forest, and arid to mixed boreal-tropical cloud forest (Rossman et al. 1996).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rBNGAx", "ELCode": "ARADB36040", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis cyrtopsis", "ITIS_TSN": "174141", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100881", "common_name": "Black-necked Gartersnake"}}
