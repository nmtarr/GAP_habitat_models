It is most abundant in spruce-fir forest, but is also found in mesophytic cove hardwoods (Huheey and Stupka 1967, Petranka 1998). Adults occupy the forest floor, sometimes well away from surface water.  They utilize moss, leaf litter, rotten logs, the bark of stumps and logs, and rocks for shelter (Martof et al. 1980). They will ascend trees to about 2 m in wet or foggy weather. Winters are spent in underground seepages.  Egg laying occurs in winter and perhaps in spring or fall in underground cavities among rocks of spring seeps. The average clutch size is 3-14. Hatching has been observed in fall.  The female remains with eggs until hatching and there is no aquatic larval stage.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aPYSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03100", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus wrighti", "ITIS_TSN": "173645", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102489", "common_name": "Pygmy Salamander"}}
