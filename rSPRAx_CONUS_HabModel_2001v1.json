Populations are found as far south as northern Colombia (Wilson 1974). Campbell (1998) reported the elevation range of this species to extend from sea level to around 1830 meters in Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThis is a species that burrows in soil, rotting logs, and leaf litter. It is generally associated with tropical and subtropical, wet, moist, and dry primary and secondary forest (Campbell 1998). The various habitats include conifer forest, hardwood forest, old fields, savanna, shrubland, chaparral, and various woodlands. At low elevations, this species can be found in lowland tropical wet forests, pine savannas, and thorn forest. At higher elevations populations occur in pine woods and cloud forest (Wilson 1974). Lee (2000) included as preferred habitats forest-pasture ecotones, areas near waterways, and even surrounding areas of heavily disturbed human settlements.\r\n\r\nGP-In Texas, Dense thickets, palm groves, and riparian woodlands (Tennant 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSPRAx", "ELCode": "ARADB12010", "scientific_name": "Drymobius margaritiferus", "ITIS_TSN": "174226", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103142", "common_name": "Speckled Racer"}}
