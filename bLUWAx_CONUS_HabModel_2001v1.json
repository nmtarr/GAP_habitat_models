(1997) suggest population numbers are diminishing due to the loss of riparian habitat from water projects and mesquite cutting. In the Santa Rita Experimental Station, Santa Rita Mountains, this species occurred in a grassland range vegetation, which included mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), cacti (Opuntia spp.), burrowweed (Haplopappus tenuisectus), acacias (Acacia spp.), ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), mimosas (Mimosa spp.), and false mesquite (Calliandra eriophylla); grass species included Arizona cottontop (Trichacne californica), threeawns (Aristida spp.), bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), several perennial grammas (Bouteloua spp.), as well as the introduced Lehman lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana; Maurer 1985). Based on the information provided by Maurer (1985), only the grassland system listed below fit. It also occurs within the known range of this species. Therefore, inclusion of this system is reasonable. This species is expected to summer and breed within this system where suitable habitat exists.\r\n\r\nLucy\u2019s Warbler nests in close association with riparian mesquite (Prosopis spp.). It also breeds in lowland cottonwood-willow (Populus-Salix) riparian gallery forests and, less often, in midelevation, sycamore-ash-live oak (Platanus-Fraxinus-Quercus). These riparian ecosystems have been greatly reduced locally throughout much of the southwestern United States, extirpating many breeding populations of Lucy\u2019s Warblers. It occupies the driest habitat of the 4 southwestern lowland-breeding warblers and has been called the \u201cmesquite warbler\u201d (Gilman 1909) and \u201cdesert warbler\u201d (Monson 1979). Breeds most often in dense lowland riparian mesquite woodlands, its breeding range coinciding closely with distribution of riparian mesquite woodland (bosques), especially where trees are large enough to provide adequate nest sites. Also nests commonly in recently introduced tamarisk. Trees and shrubs in bosques include acacias (Acacia spp.), hackberries (Celtis spp.), and elderberries, or \u201celders\u201d (Sambucus, especially Mexican elder [S. mexicana]; Arnold 1940, Brandt 1951). Breeds in low densities in mesquites of more mesic upland desert scrub and desert grassland, and especially in xeroriparian vegetation along dry desert washes. Lucy\u2019s Warbler may be found in willows and arrowweed (Tessaria sericea) close to a river, and less often in paloverdes (Cercidium spp.) and ironwoods (Olneya tesota) in desert uplands, but its closest association with mesquite was noted early along the lower Colorado River near Blythe, CA, by Grinnell (1914). Similar situation occurs near confluence of Salt River with Verde River in central Arizona.\r\nLowland riparian breeding habitat includes mesquite and willow \u201cthickets\u201d (Howard 1899), cottonwood-mesquite (Phillips et al. 1964), cottonwood-willow gallery forests, cottonwoods (Carothers et al. 1974), willows (Brewster 1882, Monson 1979), and midelevation ash-walnut-sycamore-live oak (Fraxinus-Juglans-Platanus-Quercus) associations (Phillips et al. 1964), while more arid habitats include (usually locally) larger stands of xeroriparian vegetation along dry desert washes or occasional upland mesquites, and rarely paloverde and ironwood (Grinnell and Miller 1944). Usually nests below 1,000 m, as low as \u201360 to 300 m in California (Small 1994); not uncommon as high as 1,220 m (Bailey 1904, 1923) but occasionally to elevations of 1,775 m\u2014e.g., in oak-sycamore-alder (Quercus - Platanus - Alnus oblongiflolia [Arizona alder]) riparian habitat surrounded by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in central Arizona (Reynolds and Johnson 1964) and 1,745 m in se. Utah (Fagan 1995). Although demonstrating a preference for native vegetation, an early record for Death Valley, CA, observed this species using tamarisk as well as mesquite (Wauer 1962). In Arizona's breeding bird atlas, found on 725 of 1834 blocks with most (54%) blocks containing mesquite, ironweed and paloverde (Corman 2005). Large populations have colonized newly established tamarisk thickets along the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon (Brown et al. 1987), where there were few earlier records of Lucy\u2019s Warbler (Behle 1948)(quoted directly from Johnson et al. 2012).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bLUWAx", "ELCode": "ABPBX01090", "scientific_name": "Vermivora luciae", "ITIS_TSN": "178866", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106111", "common_name": "Lucy's Warbler"}}
