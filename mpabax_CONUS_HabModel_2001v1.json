Similar patterns exist for: mesquite bosques (Williams et al., 2006; Bucci et al., 2010); pinyon-juniper woodland (Jones, 1965; Ports and Bradley, 1996; Szewczak et al., 1998; Kuenzi et al., 1999); and Sierran and coastal California mixed conifer forests (Orr, 1954; Morrell et al., 1999; Zielinski and Gellman, 1999; Baker et al., 2008).\r\n\r\nA. pallidus prefers low canopy cover (Baker et al., 2008) and it avoids marshes (Williams et al., 2006).\r\n\r\nThe pallid bat roosts in: rock crevices in boulders or in cliffs (Finley, 1954; Hirshfeld et al., 1977; O\u2019Shea and Vaughan, 1977; Chapman et al., 1994; Ports and Bradley, 1996; Ball, 1998; Ball, 2002); on and in trees (Hirshfeld et al., 1977; Ball, 1998; Ball, 2002; Baker et al., 2008); buildings (Beck and Rudd, 1960; Hirshfeld et al., 1977; Bell, 1982; Szewczak et al., 1998; Gitzen et al., 2002; Lenhart et al., 2010) under bridges (Beck and Rudd, 1960; Davis and Cockrum, 1962; Geluso and Mink, 2006); in caves (Port and Bradley, 1996; Ball, 1998; Ball, 2002); and mines (Port and Bradley, 1996). The species hibernates in caves and mines (Port and Bradley, 1996), but due to the number of winter capture in New Mexico, Geluso (2007) posited that the species may not be an obligate hibernator throughout its range.\r\n\r\nDistances between roosts and foraging areas can be as much as 8.5 km (Ball, 1998; Ball, 2002).\r\n\r\nElevations at which the pallid bat is found range from near sea level in California to nearly 2450 m in New Mexico (Black, 1974). In British Columbia, maximum elevations were around 500 m (Chapman et al., 1994).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPABAx", "ELCode": "AMACC10010", "scientific_name": "Antrozous pallidus", "ITIS_TSN": "180006", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106431", "common_name": "Pallid Bat"}}
