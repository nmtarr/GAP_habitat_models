However, in New Mexico, this species is associated with high talus slopes far from permanent water (Animas Mountains, Hidalgo County) and other isolated populations. Quiet pools of intermittent and permanent streams are preferred that usually have a hard, rocky bottom. Intermittent streams that are preferred have some amount of water throughout the year. Found also in arroyos and streams of semiarid grasslands usually bordered by sycamore and cottonwood, also pi\u00f1on-juniper, pine-oak woodlands, and tropical scrub forests (Mexico localities). Ground-dwelling, but also found to climb trees and boulders (Behler and King 1979; Conant and Collins 1998; Stebbins 2003). Found on boulders, rocks, cliffs near creeks, springs and rivers, even found in rocky talus far from water. Also in Arizona, occupies Upland Desert Scrub through Petran Montane Conifer Forest where declining populations may be due to the reported presence of the chytrid fungus (Brennan and Holycross 2009; Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nRange expands from western Colorado and south Utah to north Oaxaca, Mexico. Also, west Texas to the Colorado River in northwest Arizona. Isolated populations are reported in the Mogollon Highlands of Arizona, Canadian and upper Pecos Rivers, Big Florida Mountains and Cookes Peak area, New Mexico (Stebbins 2003). In Texas, its range includes the Chisos and Davis mountains and canyons of the Trans-Pecos region (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding also occurs in pools of rocky streams made of solid rock from canyon bottoms or pools formed by rains on top of rock cliffs (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCYTRx", "ELCode": "AAABC02020", "scientific_name": "Hyla arenicolor", "ITIS_TSN": "173510", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102412", "common_name": "Canyon Treefrog"}}
