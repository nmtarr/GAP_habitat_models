The distribution of the birds of California. Pac. Coast Avifauna no. 27. Cooper Ornithol. Club, Berkeley, CA."}, "habitat_description": "Northwest:\r\nGrinnell and Miller (1944) characterized habitat use in California as chiefly tracts of deciduous trees along stream bottoms, especially in canyons; but also planted orchards where irrigated. Females in these habitats nested in canyon-bottom woodlands, but tended to nest over water in sycamores more often than oaks. If no stream was available, nests were in vegetation that overlooked a flat, bare area. In w. Colorado, nesting habitats also include pi\u00f1on-juniper woodlands and Gambel\u2019s oak (Quercus gambelii) shrublands (Andrews and Righter 1992). In lower Colorado River Valley and some of its major tributaries, Black-chinned Hummingbirds now nest almost exclusively in introduced salt-cedar (Tamarix ramosissima) or near houses (Rosenberg et al. 1987). In Grand Canyon, nests only in salt-cedar patches >0.5 ha in size with a mean height of 1.4 m and vegetative cover =69% (Brown 1992). Before salt-cedar became so widespread, presumably willows were dominant component of their habitat (Grinnell 1914). Farther west, in California, may nest in irrigated orchards and edges of agricultural lands where there are trees (Small 1994). At north edge of range (British Columbia), all breeding records have been from residential areas and orchards (Campbell et al. 1990)(quoted directly from Baltosser and Russell 2000).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Big Bend area of Texas, Scott (1994) found Black-chinneds occasionally nesting on arid slickrock and talus slopes used for nesting by Lucifer Hummingbirds (Calothorax lucifer). Both species were found at same elevations, but more often Black-chinneds nested in lowland areas, for example in gray oak (Quercus grisea) and Mexican-buckeye (Ungnadia speciosa) in dry washes, as well as cottonwoods in desert oases, and in abundance along the Rio Grande (mainly in Tamarix), where the Lucifer was scarce (P. Scott pers. comm.). In late summer, both species found in washes having plentiful stands of narrow-leaf desert-honeysuckle (Anisacanthus linearis). Xeric sites used by both species characterized by lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), Havard\u2019s century-plant (Agave havardiana), ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), green sotol (Dasylirion leiophyllum), and other plants of upper-elevation Chihuahuan desertscrub (Pulich and Pulich 1963). Along south fork of Concho River near Christoval, TX, Black-chinned occupies the flood plain (B. Ortego pers. comm.) forested with plateau oaks (Quercus fusiformis), pecan (Carya illinoensis), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). In areas of Texas where breeding range of Black-chinned abuts that of the Ruby-throated Hummingbird (i.e., Coastal Bend region, area around Austin, and near Fort Worth), Black-chinned nests in vegetation that is more xeric than that utilized by the Ruby-throated (Dixon 1989)(quoted directly from Baltosser and Russell 2000).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nIt occurs in desertscrub (creosote-bursage), transition zone (oak-pine, oak-juniper, and pine woodlands), riparian woodlands (mixed deciduous forests including cottonwood, sycamore, willow, tamarisk, and mesquite bosques). In the southwest, it occurs in mesic vegetation types including cottonwood (Populus spp.), sycamore (Platanus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), hackberry (Celtis spp.) and Oak (Quercus spp.); in most regions, it selects for canyon or flood-plain riparian woodlands (Baltosser and Russell 2000). Mearns (1890) suggests this species is not observed higher than Ponderosa pine forest. In Arizona, it is a \u201ccommon summer resident\u201d in certain deciduous associations of Sonoran Zones, and is generally absent from deserts (Phillips et al. 1978; Monson and Phillips 1981), as well as riparian woodlands in southeastern Arizona (Edison et al. 1995). This species occurs in foothill country, along wooded streams and within the pine belt throughout the state (Swarth 1914). In the Lower Colorado River Valley, this species is \u201cwidespread\u201d in riparian vegetation and around human residences (Rosenberg et al. 1991). In the Chiricahua Mountains, this species is \u201cuncommon\u201d in the deserts (Tanner and Hardy 1958). In Colorado, Kingery (1998) suggests deciduous habitats, including riparian, urban and rural situations (including shelterbelts, orchards, and manmade structures), and lower-elevation brushy and urban habitats, account for 84% of Colorado Bird Atlas observations. There are two scales of habitat selection for this species \u2013 foraging areas and nest sites; foraging areas consist of open brush, meadows and fields, and nest sites are treed or other covered areas for nesting (Kingery 1998).  Along the Verde River, this species was identified in mixed deciduous riparian forest (Carothers et al. 1974).  In New Mexico, at locations throughout the state, this species was recorded from 4500 to 8000 feet (1363-2424 meters) elevation (Bailey 1928); Ben\u00e9 (1946) suggests it occurs within the transition zone from 5000 to 7000 feet (1515-2121 meters) elevation.  In New Mexico, it is confined, mainly during breeding, from 3500 to 7000 feet (1060-2121 meters) elevation (Ligon 1961), which Hubbard (1978) describes as \u201clow to middle elevations.\u201d In Guadalupe Canyon, this hummer nested in relatively open areas with clumps of mature stands of Arizona sycamore (Baltosser 1989).  In Arizona, nesting females are found principally among willows, cottonwoods and sycamores along streams, and in olive trees within towns (Phillips et al. 1978).  They tend to select for the mouths of canyons where sycamores occur in association with water, but may also occur in dry washes within small patches of willows (Johnsgard 1983).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBCHUx", "ELCode": "ABNUC45020", "scientific_name": "Archilochus alexandri", "ITIS_TSN": "178033", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104387", "common_name": "Black-chinned Hummingbird"}}
