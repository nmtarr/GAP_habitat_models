It is found in most upper elevation forests, particularly spruce-fir (Martof et al. 1980), but also in mixed and deciduous forests of birch-spruce, birch-hemlock or northern hardwoods.  Populations are usually found on forested mountain summits, in mesic woodland, talus slopes, and in cove hardwood forests (Redmond and Scott 1996) and can also be found in grassy spots and boulder fields.  They are usually found under rocks, logs, or leaf litter during day.  P. welleri tends to be most abundant in forests with much cover of rocks and downed logs (Mitchell 1991).  They apparently mate in the fall.  Eggs are laid in a cluster of 4-13 eggs in summer in small cavities in rotting conifer logs or beneath moss mats.  The female stays with eggs until hatching in August or September.  The larval stage is passed in the egg.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aWLSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12230", "scientific_name": "Plethodon welleri", "ITIS_TSN": "173675", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104883", "common_name": "Weller's Salamander"}}
