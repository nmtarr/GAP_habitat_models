It's association with pines, particularly mature pines, may make it an indicator species for the health of southeastern pine forests, which have been extensively logged for the last century (quoted directly from Withgott et al. 1998).\r\nOccurs almost exclusively in association with pine (Pinus) trees, in wide variety of southeastern pine forest habitats. Two principal forest types (loblolly-shortleaf association of the upper Coastal Plain, and longleaf-slash association of the lower Coastal Plain) are among those with highest abundance of Brown-headed Nuthatch (Hamel 1992). Within these forest types, this species is most common in open, mature, old-growth pine forest, particularly where natural fire patterns have been maintained. Less frequently but regularly found in stands of young or medium-aged pine, in mixed pine-hardwood stands, and in mature pine stands with heavy undergrowth. Also may occur in residential areas, particularly parks and neighborhoods with large pines rising from open areas. Since this species uses snags (standing dead trees) for nesting and roosting, typically requires areas in which snags are present. Foraging, however, centers on live pines. This combination of vegetation characteristics occurs in (1) mature pine forest in which fire has kept understory open and created snags, (2) small clearings created either naturally (e.g., by hurricanes, disease, or bark beetles) or artificially (e.g., by clear-cutting) in which snags have been left standing, or (3) forest-wetland ecotones where snags are created by water incursion. Most of these pine-dominated ecosystems are fire-dependent (Wright and Bailey 1982), and many coastal-plain pine forest and pine savanna areas abut wetlands. May breed in residential areas if snags or nest boxes, as well as mature living pines, are available  (quoted directly from Withgott et al. 1998).\r\nClearly more abundant in older pine stands than in younger ones (Johnston and Odum 1956, Meyers and Johnson 1978, Johnson and Landers 1982, Repenning and Labisky 1985). In Texas, presence related positively to large, mature pines and negatively to development of understory vegetation (Conner et al. 1983); prefers intermediate-aged stands if they contain more grassy openings and decayed wood than older stands (Dickson and Segelquist 1979). Breeding Bird Census data show presence in >50% of mature loblolly-shortleaf and longleaf-slash stands, presence in minority of young loblolly-shortleaf and oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) stands and intermediate loblolly-shortleaf stands, and absence in intermediate and mature hardwood stands (Dickson et al. 1980). For foraging, found to use more open stands with less basal area, fewer hardwoods, and less canopy closure (O\u2019Halloran and Conner 1987). Apparently favors burned stands over unburned stands, and particularly recently burned stands (Wilson et al. 1995). In Florida, will nest in cypress (Taxodium distichum) swamps and prairies adjoining pine woodland (Stevenson and Anderson 1994, Slater 1997) (quoted directly from Withgott et al. 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBHNUx", "ELCode": "ABPAZ01040", "scientific_name": "Sitta pusilla", "ITIS_TSN": "178785", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104638", "common_name": "Brown-headed Nuthatch"}}
