These water bodies must persist for at least 60 days to allow egg and tadpole development (Hillis et al., 1984). Calls have been documented in lakes, manmade ponds, roadside ditches, flooded fields/pastures, and rain pools in forest, clearings, or residential areas (USFWS, 1984). In addition to its hydrologic requirements, the species is limited to areas of friable, sandy soils for burrowing and aestivation (Hillis et al., 1984; USFWS, 1984; Forstner and Swannack, 2004). Habitat near breeding sites includes forests of loblolly, post oak, blackjack oak, and/or red cedar (Hillis et al., 1984; Forstner and Swannack, 2004; Brown et al., 2013). Such forests are often interspersed with grassy patches, pasture, or coastal prairie (USFWS, 1984; Forstner and Swannack, 2004), with the species not documented farther than 25 m from the forest edge (Forstner and Swannack, 2004; Vanderwege et al., 2013). Furthermore, individuals only travel up to 200 m from ponds (Swannack, 2007).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aHOTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01090", "scientific_name": "Anaxyrus houstonensis", "ITIS_TSN": "773522", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103748", "common_name": "Houston Toad"}}
