California Wildlife Habitat Relationship System life history report states that this species is: \"Permanent, locally common resident of chaparral, hardwood, and coniferous habitats that support substantial brush understory. Occurs below 2700 m (8900 ft) in the South Coast, Transverse, Peninsular, and southern Sierra Nevada Ranges. \" ([CAWHR - Harvey and Polite] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). Habitat for T. merriami is typically moist regions of upper elevations containing Jefferey and Coulter pine and various oaks with manzanita, wild rose, and other understory associations (Wilson and Ruff 1999). It occurs in chaparral slopes with mixed oak-pine forests as well as streamside thickets and rock outcroppings. Additional tree/shrub associations include ceanothus, blue and black oak, digger pine, bigcone pine, bigcone spruce, lodgepole pine, single-leaf pinyon and juniper (Johnson 1943, Best and Granai 1994).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMMCHx", "ELCode": "AMAFB02090", "scientific_name": "Tamias merriami", "ITIS_TSN": "180194", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101063", "common_name": "Merriam's Chipmunk"}}
