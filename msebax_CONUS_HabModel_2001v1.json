It was once believed that it roosted primarily in Spanish moss during summer, but telemetry studies revealed that it roosts in clumps of slash and loblolly pine needles (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Many roosts have been found at the edge or near clearings, or bordering lakes and streams, where Spanish moss or dense clumps of foliage are commonly used for concealment (Webster et al. 1985, Brown 1997).  Preferred roosting trees are tall, large ones in mature pine forest (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Known winter roost types include overstory tree canopies, vines, shrubs, and leaf litter (Ammerman et al. 2012).  This species prefers cypress forests and other hydric woodlands (Brown 1997) with roosts typically in pines, primarily loblolly (Menzel et al. 2003).  It occurs in wooded habitats including Okeefenokee, uplands, prairies, shrub swamps, blackgum forest, bay forest, cypress, and mixed cypress.   In North Carolina, they forage at canopy height but over water and clearings within pine stands, bottomland hardwood forest, and upland hardwood forests (Ammerman et al. 2012).  In Florida habitat includes pine flatwoods, scrubby flatwoods, hammocks, lowland forests, river swamps, and longleaf-turkey oak.  Forage at treetop level over watercourses, barren, clearings, prairies, and hammocks (Wilkins 1987).  Seminole bats identified as utilizing pine plantations in MS (Miller 2003).  \r\n\r\nSeminole Bats have not been found above 500 m in elevation (Wilkins 1987).
