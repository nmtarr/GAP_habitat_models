In the northern localities of its range it inhabits prairie grassland and sandhills. The southern populations are found along streamside thickets, fir forests, creosote bush desert, oak shrubland, vacant lots, dumps, and pinyon/juniper and pine/oak woodland (Conant and Collins 1998; Degenhardt et al. 1996; Hammerson 1999; Stebbins 2003).
