It feeds in swamps, riparian zones along creeks and streams, marshes, ditches, canals, ponds, lake edges, sloughs, mangrove swamps, and clearly prefers thick vegetation (Brown et al. 1982, Kaiser and Fritzell 1984, Clarke et al. 1984, Bryant 1914).  In salt marshes, it tends to hug creek banks and avoid open flats frequented by longer-legged herons (Davis and Kushlan 1994).\r\n\r\nGreen Herons nest in various habitats providing secluded nest sites and wetland feeding habitat.  These habitats include swamps, marshes, lakes, ponds, human-made or human-regulated habitats such as storm-water control impoundments and retention basins, and even in dry woods and orchards in farmlands where feeding sites are available (Davis and Kushlan 1994).  Like other herons, they often nest on islands or tree islands in marshes.  Although they usually nest on or over water, they sometimes place nests in upland areas up to 0.8 km from standing water (Davis and Kushlan 1994).  Reported nest site substrates include shrubs (Virginia), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda, Virginia), buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis, Tennessee) Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana, Tennessee), cedars (Tennessee), post oak (Quercus stellata, Arkansas), willow (Salix sp., Minnesota and California), pitch pines (Pinus rigida, Massachusetts), cedars, sassafras, and hickories on salt-marsh islands (Massachusetts), and black willows (Salix nigra, North Carolina, Davis and Kushlan 1994).  In Missouri, they use honey locust, buttonbush, black willow, box elder (Acer negundo), and short leaf pine (Pinus echinata) (Davis and Kushlan 1994).  In the Southwest, nests may be built away from water in dry woodlands and orchards, on low tussocks or muskrat houses, as well as in trees near water (DeGraff and Rappole 1995, Johnsgard 1992).  Although its habitats include water sources such as swampy areas, fresh streams, ponds, irrigation canals, shorelines, it chooses freshwater with trees for breeding habitat (Davis 1997). \r\n\r\nIn Colorado they are summer residents on the eastern plains, and accidental in mountain parks, mountains, and western valleys.  They inhabit a wide variety of freshwater and saltwater communities including wet woodlands, lakeshores, ponds, rivers, streams, swamps, marshes, wooded rivers, and the edges of reservoirs, but are primarily found in riparian deciduous zones (Johnsgard 1992, Andrews and Righter 1992, DeGraff and Rappole 1995).  They are rarely present during winter.  In Utah, Green Herons are rare summer residents, breeding only in Washington County in the southwestern corner of the state (Utah CDC 2003).   They can generally be seen in association with shoreline and marsh habitats that border open water (BISON-M 2003).  Some individuals winter in southern Arizona (Natureserve 2004).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, Green Herons use all available marine and freshwater habitats, and mangrove swamps are heavily used in tropical areas (Davis and Kushlan 1994).
