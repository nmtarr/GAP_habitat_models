Southern cricket frogs may be declining locally mainly due to the disappearance of suitable upland habitat caused by soil disturbance in Georgia, Florida, and south Alabama. There is a negative correlation with the number of pines surrounding bodies of water and frequency of sightings throughout their range (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nFound primarily in the lowlands, found in Coastal Plain bogs, ponds, and river-bottom swamps; known to follow streams upward into upland areas (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding occurs throughout the year in Florida while populations in Alabama have a breeding peak during the summer; Habitat used by adults is very similar habitat used for breeding can be almost any type freshwater to include lake margins, sinkhole ponds, roadside ditches, shallow ponds, open grassy ponds, bogs, Carolina bays, and bottomland swamps (Lannoo 2005). Also found breeding using interdunal ponds within 18.3 meters from the ocean (Neill 1958 in Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSCFRx", "ELCode": "AAABC01020", "scientific_name": "Acris gryllus", "ITIS_TSN": "173518", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103292", "common_name": "Southern Cricket Frog"}}
