Breeding habitats as indicated by parasitized nests show preference for wood-field ecotones rather than either extensive woods or extensive field or prairie areas (Gates and Gysel 1978, Brittingham and Temple 1983, Johnson and Temple 1990)(quoted directly from Lowther 1993).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nBrown-headed cowbirds can be found during the breeding season in woodland, primarily deciduous forest edge, city parks, suburban gardens, farms, ranches. Before European settlement of the eastern U.S., cowbirds were apparently limited to the open grasslands of the United States, mostly west of the Mississippi River. However, because the cowbirds need suitable perches for searching for nests to parasitize, the species was probably limited in the breeding season to prairie riparian corridors (Mayfield 1965). The main reason for cowbird expansion outside of the Great Plains appears to be the fragmentation of once unbroken forest tracts into small pieces of forest interspersed with fields, pastures, roads, and towns (Mayfield 1977, Kerlinger and Doremus 1981). Cowbirds often are associated with forest-field edge habitat and clearings in forests.\r\nFeedlots, pastures, and fields with livestock also attract cowbirds, especially in predominately forested areas. Brown-headed cowbirds select ecotones between forest and open habitat for breeding, rather than using extensive open area and forest edge (Gates and Gysel 1978, Brittingham and Temple 1983, Johnson and Temple 1990). Curson et. Al (1999) found that females commute > 20 km from pasture lands into mixed coniferous forest and woodland to lay eggs. Brittingham and Temple (1983) found that cowbirds parasitized nests 300 m into the interior of forests from gaps >= 0.2 ha.  Best (1978) and Johnson and Temple (1990) found that cowbirds parasitized nests in grassland habitat 100 m from forest edge into grasslands. Fragmentation of eastern forests has made large areas accessible to cowbirds. Of 1,645 nest cards from Ontario, 897 were farmland areas (overgrown fields, fence rows, young conifer plantations, orchards, open fields), 235 woodland areas, 232 residential areas (Peck and James 1987). Breeding bird atlas distribution maps also show association with agricultural areas (quoted directly from Lowther 1993).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nIn the Sierra Nevada of California, cowbirds feed in horse corrals, meadows with herds of cattle, and at bird feeders in towns, and few cowbirds are found more than 10 km from these food sources (Verner and Ritter 1983). In this same area, the number of cowbirds in meadows decreases as the distance of the meadow from pack stations and horse corrals increases. Uses trees, shrubs, herbage for cover, mostly roosts in trees (Grinnell and Miller 1944), usually in riparian or urban habitats, or in groves of trees bordering good foraging habitat. Breeds most commonly in riparian habitats, along moist forest edges, and in other diverse, productive habitats where density of passerine host populations high. Parasitism rates highest near areas of food abundance in Sierra Nevada (Airola 1986). Typically forages in open, moist habitats in vicinity of grazing animals or human-occupied areas. Roosts and breeds primarily in riparian wood Usually feeds on ground in open, moist habitats; pastures, wet meadows, croplands and other areas with short, grassy vegetation (Mayfield 1965). Many breeders in California migrate to wintering areas south of the state. Usually a rare winter resident in lowlands of northern California except in local congregations (Laymon 1987). A very local winter resident in southern deserts, but common in Imperial and Colorado River valleys, and fairly common in southern coastal areas. In montane habitats, occurrence often restricted to a brief period when potential hosts are laying eggs; abundance declines abruptly by late July or early August (Gaines 1977, Rothstein et al. 1980, Verner and Ritter 1983)(quoted directly from Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\nEats mainly seeds and arthropods (Lowther 1993). Are seen frequently with ungulates, which disturb insect prey (Lowther 1993). Cowbirds commonly hunt for slow-flying insects at pack horse stations (Lowther 1993). Prefer wood-field ecotones and are seen in large numbers on meadow edges and have a preference for human-modified habitat (Lowther 1993). This species parisitizes the nests of other birds by laying its eggs in the nests of other species for it to hatch (Lowther 1993). This bird is a shortgrass-edge species and are limited to areas where some shortgrass is available for foraging and where perches provide them with sites from which to search from their host nest (Ortega 1998). Typically found in association with large herds of grazing mammals that flush up insects (Ortega 1998). Habitat alteration occurred with human settlement and the introduction of livestock (Ortega 1998). Common summer resident of less dense Sonoran desert zones (Monson and Phillips 1981). Common in pinyon-juniper woodland in New Mexico in summer but uncommon in Arizona in summer in the same zone; typical habitat is forest edge, savannas, marshes, parks and gardens (Ligon 1961). Feeds in pastures and feedlots; often associated with livestock (Dolbeer 1994). Summer resident in the Sandia mountains; common in pinyon-juniper woodland and ponderosa pine (Tatschl 1967). This species prefers open habitats and is commonly associated with livestock (Johnsgard 1979). In Clark County, Nevada it is a permanent resident of desert scrub and riparian areas; summer resident in woodlands; transient in montane forests (Alcorn 1988). Can be found in association with prairie dog towns (Lomolino and Smith 2004).  In the centennial mountains of Idaho, this species can be found in the summer at elevations ranging from 1860-1940 m, with major vegetation including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willows (Douglas et al. 1992). Found in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998). Favorite roosting places in Arizona are cattails, oleander hedges, and date palms (Phillips et al. 1978). Found up to 2,895m in Colorado (Lowther 1993). Occurs as high as 2,439m in New Mexico (Ligon 1961).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBHCOx", "ELCode": "ABPBXB7030", "scientific_name": "Molothrus ater", "ITIS_TSN": "179112", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102638", "common_name": "Brown-headed Cowbird"}}
