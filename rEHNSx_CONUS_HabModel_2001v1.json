The habitat includes forest edges, fields, fire-managed pinelands, forest-grassland ecotones, river valleys, woodland meadows, barrier islands, and openly wooded upland hills. The habitat of preference is usually characterized by the presence of amphibian prey and loose soils.The eastern hog-nosed snake is described as a terrestrial snake that burrows in or using soil; it crawls over the surface and burrows into soil. It is known to hibernate in burrows or under rocks of talus slopes. Eggs are laid in nests only a few inches below the surface or in decaying wood (Degraaf and Rudis 1983; Platt 1969).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEHNSx", "ELCode": "ARADB17020", "scientific_name": "Heterodon platirhinos", "ITIS_TSN": "563935", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106140", "common_name": "Eastern Hog-nosed Snake"}}
