Given this fact, along with the species\u2019 recent reclassification, knowledge of its habitat is inferred from research on its former conspecifics S. mollis and S. canus.\r\n\r\nS. townsendii inhabits shrub-steppe in the Columbia Basin. Plant associations within which the species is commonly found include: sagebrush and wheatgrass (Hedlund and Rickard, 1981); big sagebrush, shadscale, and winterfat (Groves and Steenhof, 1988; Yensen et al., 1992; Sharpe and Van Horne, 1998; Van Horne et al., 1998); sagebrush and bluegrass (Smith and Johnson, 1985); winterfat and cheatgrass (Smith and Johnson, 1985); winterfat and bluegrass (Smith and Johnson, 1985; Yensen et al., 1992); winterfat, big sagebrush, hop sage, Russian thistle, and cheatgrass (Smith and Johnson, 1985); winterfat and sagebrush (Van Horne et al., 1998). Reports of the species\u2019 response to fire are mixed; however, generally, Townsend\u2019s ground squirrels will inhabit recently burned shrubland (Hedlund and Rickard, 1981; Smith and Johnson, 1985; Groves and Steenhof, 1988).\r\n\r\nTownsend\u2019s ground squirrels are not found on grazed land (Medin and Clary, 1989). Their use of pure grasslands is not well-documented, as observations in the absence of shrubs are limited to recently burned shrublands (Groves and Steenhof, 1988; Smith and Johnson, 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mTGSQx", "ELCode": "AMAFB05010", "scientific_name": "Urocitellus townsendii", "ITIS_TSN": "930323", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102480", "common_name": "Townsend's Ground Squirrel"}}
