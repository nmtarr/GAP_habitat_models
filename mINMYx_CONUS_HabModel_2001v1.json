In Spring, reproductive females migrate to wooded areas where they form maternity colonies to raise their young.  Maternity colonies use between 10 and 20 trees.   Females are philopatric to their breeding habitat sites as well.  Males and non-reproductive females also inhabit wooded areas but often remain close to their hibernacula (<~3.5 km).  They roost in winter hibernacula as well as behind the bark of large trees during the day and night between foraging bouts (USFWS 2007).  Records exist of females traveling up to 575 km from hibernacula to maternity roost areas.  Some females stay much closer to their hibernacula but travel directly to breeding sites after they leave the hibernaculum; an individual was recorded flying 60 miles to its summer breeding site on the first day out of hibernation (USFWS 2007).\r\nA wide variety of tree species are used as roosts indicating that the tree species identity is not as important as its physical characteristics and location.  Dead trees are most often used but sometimes live trees are used as well (UWFWS 2007).  Primary roosts are typically under exfoliating bark of a dead ash, elm, hickory, maple, oak or poplar within forest canopy openings or along forests edges.  They are sometimes in trees within opening but generally within 15 m of forest in those cases.  Maternity roosts are in trees slightly bigger (mean = 45 cm) than adult males roosts (mean = 33 cm; USFWS 2007).   Non-maternity roosts are usually in trees that are tall compared to surrounding canopy trees, receive at least half a day of direct sunlight, and are in forest canopy, a fenceline, or along a wooded edge (USFWS 2007).\r\nEarly research suggested that Indiana Bats are associated with water and that their distribution is determined by the distribution of water.  However, subsequent studies have brought this into question (USFWS 2007).  Known maternity roosts are located in riparian zones, bottomland and floodplain habitats, wooded wetlands, and upland communities (USFWS 2007).  \r\nIndiana Bats forage in wooded areas that are floodplains, riparian, lowland, or upland, but some individuals have been captured in open habitats.  In Illinois, they preferred floodplain forest followed by ponds, old fields (along edges), row crops (along edges), upland woods, and pastures.  In Indiana preferred habitats were woodlands, agricultural edges, low-density residential housing, and open water.  In Virginia, they showed a preference for open deciduous forests.  Measures of the distances traveled from roosts to foraging sites have been variable but been below 9 km, with average differences below 2.5 km (USFWS 2007). \r\nDuring migration flights, linear features of the landscape such as forest edges are followed.  \r\nHabitat modeling has revealed that the variable with most predictive power in explaining suitability is the availability of roost trees.  The amount of land in forest, diversity of ecosystems, and area of water did little to predict suitability.  Several studies have examined the importance of land cover type in the landscape surrounding maternity colonies.  However, these studies have had mixed results; the estimated importance has varied and percent forest cover around known colonies varies from low to moderate values (USFWS 2007).\r\nThe highest elevation of a maternity colony is 1,158 m and is in North Carolina.   \r\nAlthough this species is generally associated with hardwood forested habitats, Britzke et al. (2003) found that within Nantahala National Forest, NC & Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN,  primary and alternate roost trees in NC  were ' in a stand that was classified as hemlock-hardwood; dominant trees were eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), Fraser magnolia (Magnolia fraseri), and sweet birch (Betula lenta) and in TN 'roosts were classified as a pine stand; dominant trees were shortleaf pine (P. echinata), eastern hemlock, and sourwood (Oxydendum arboreum). The primary roost for GSMNP was in a stand classified as pine; dominant species were pitch pine (P. rigida), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), Virginia pine (P. virginiana), and black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica).\r\nN.
