Disjunct populations occurred in central and southeast Louisiana (Conant and Collins 1991). More specifically, the dusky gopher frog is an endemic to Saint Tammany, Washington, and Tangipahoa parishes in the coastal plain of Louisiana. In Mississippi, it occurs in the Hancock, Jackson, Harrison, and Pearl River Counties. They were also present in southwestern Alabama and up to 1967 in Louisiana (Lannoo 2005). Current breeding populations are known only from Glen\u2019s Pond, found in DeSoto National Forest in Harrison County, Mississippi (Richter et al. 2003). Due to severe declines recently, reported populations are only found in Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi (IUCN 2015).\r\n\r\nBreeding habitat is generally shallow ephemeral ponds that are characterized by subemergent and emergent vegetation, and floating, decaying woody litter (Lannoo 2005). Seasonal non-breeding habitat includes upland and flatland longleaf pine forests with open canopies (Dundee and Rossman 1989).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aDGFRx", "ELCode": "AAABH01310", "scientific_name": "Lithobates sevosus", "ITIS_TSN": "775113", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103781", "common_name": "Dusky Gopher Frog"}}
