It is associated primarily with sandy grasslands and mesquite stands (Thompson et al. 1996).  Habitat association is based on soil type and distribution of grassland or shrubland (Thompson et al. 1996).  It occurs among cottonwood, willow, pinyon-juniper, mesquite, grama \"short-grass\", shinnery oak scrub, sagebrush, creosotebush, ocotillo, tarbush, winter-fat, yucca, buffalograss, big bluestem, sand bluestem, tobosa, galleta, and ricegrass (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  PNV - mixed \"short-grass\" (Thompson et al. 1996).  The species has no close association with forests except Gambel's oak and pinyon-juniper with the right soil type and distribution of grassland or shrubland (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  It has been taken along fences with little to no cover but abundant burrow openings (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  O. leucogaster may require edaphic characteristics in habitat that allow for frequent dust-bathing (McCarty 1978).\r\nThough its diet is mainly insects and other small mammals, it also eats seeds (sunflower) in summer months (McCarty 1978).  It needs plenty of water (McCarty 1978).\r\nThe species is commonly associated with Dipodomys ordii (Thompson et al. 1996).  It is often replaced by O. torridus in areas of clay soils and desert pavement in southern New Mexico (Thompson et al. 1996).  Nest burrows have an average depth of 14 cm (McCarty 1978). Home range size is 2.3ha (McCarty 1978). Elevation is 305-2,439m (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). O. torridus occurs throughout Arizona except the southwest (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found throughout Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Colorado GAP, NatureServe). The species occurs nearly statewide in Nevada (Hall 1995). It is found throughout New Mexico (Anderson 1972, Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). In Utah it does not occur in the northeast (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP). Can be found in the following mountain ranges: Animas Mountains, San Andres Mountains, Pine Forest Range, Humboldt Range, Kawich Range, Bull Run Mountains, Maverick Springs Range, and the Huachuca Mountains.\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, the Northern grasshopper mouse is associated with sandy grasslands and open brushlands, occupying burrows of other small mammals (Schmidly 2004). In Kansas and Oklahoma, they occupy sandy soils with little mulch, short-grass prairies, semi-stabilized dunes, and grasslands (Kaufman and Fleharty 1974, Ruffer 1964, McCarty (1978)).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn California, this species is \"common in alpine dwarf-shrub, sagebrush, low sage, bitterbrush, alkali desert scrub, desert scrub, annual and perennial grassland, and some wet meadow habitats\" (quoted directly from [Brylski et al. 2005] based on Zeiner et al. 1990). In Oregon, O. leucogaster has been captured in sandy soils among gray rabbitbrush, scattered cheatgrass, buckwheat, Sandberg bluegrass, snakeweed, and sagebrush. However, they were not captured in marsh grasslands or black greasewood (Small and Verts 1983, Verts and Carraway 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mNGMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF06010", "scientific_name": "Onychomys leucogaster", "ITIS_TSN": "180382", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104168", "common_name": "Northern Grasshopper Mouse"}}
