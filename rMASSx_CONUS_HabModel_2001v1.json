Habitat in the eastern part of the range includes sphagnum bogs, fens, swamps, marshes, peatlands, wet meadows, and floodplains; also open sanannas, prairies, old fields, and dry woodland; the snakes often occur in wetlands in fall, winter, and spring, in drier adjacent uplands in summer.\r\n\r\nIn the western part of the range, the habitat includes grassy wetland, rocky hillsides, mesquite/scrub plains, thornbrush, oak-grass, dry prairie, desert grassland, and sand dunes of coast and offshore islands (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Hammerson 1999, Werler and Dixon 2000). In Texas, this snake often occurs near moist microhabitats or sources of water (Werler and Dixon 2000). In Mexico, massasaugas have been reported from dry shrubby areas that also include wetlands or lush riparian areas (Campbell and Lamar 2004).\r\n\r\nSWReGAP\r\nUsually found in moist habitats but in the SW it is restricted to habitats such as river bottoms, dry grasslands, and plains of mesquite, juniper, grass, yucca, creosote, and cacti (Ernst 1992).  In the western portion of its range, massasauga occur in desert grasslands, particularly in low areas of rank growth (Stebbins 2003).  In the Rio Grande Valley, massasauga can be found in low plains of mesquite, juniper, and grassland , especially where soils are sandy (Stebbins 2003).  In southestern AZ it is found in yucca grassland (Stebbins 2003).  Also found in cactus-agave habitats (Stebbins 2003).  In New Mexico, this snake inhabits the desert grassland or shortgrass prairies with sandy soils and they tend to avoid rocky habitat (Degenhardt et al. 1996).  Common in low growing, shrubby shinnery oak habitat in southeastern New Mexico where they are associated with pure stands of shinnery oak or a mixture of oak and various herbs and grasses (Degenhardt et al. 1996).  Massasauga may be attracted to sandy soils where abundant prey such as rodents and lizards exist (Hammerson 1999). In arid regions, massasauga use rodent burrows as retreats; these burrows provide a humid microclimate that helps slow moisture loss from the snake\u2019s body (Ernst 1992).  Found from sea level to 1,500m (Ernst 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rMASSx", "ELCode": "ARADE03010", "scientific_name": "Sistrurus catenatus", "ITIS_TSN": "174304", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100049", "common_name": "Massasauga"}}
