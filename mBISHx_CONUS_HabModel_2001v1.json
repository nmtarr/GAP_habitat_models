The species requires high visibility (Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Wakelyn, 1987; Demarchi et al., 2000; Demarchi, 2004; Beecham et al., 2007), therefore structure plays a more direct role in habitat selection than composition (Beecham et al., 2007). Demarchi (2004) quantified bighorn sheeps\u2019 structure/visibility requirements, indicating a minimum 55% visibility at a distance of 14 m in all directions, at a height of 90 cm above the ground. Due to this restriction, the species rarely uses forest or dense woodland (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007), though use of forest edge, open forest, woodlands\u2014particularly by rams and during winter\u2014is well documented (Oldemeyer et al., 1971; Demarchi and Mitchell, 1973; Tilton and Willard, 1982; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007). Similarly, the species avoids: dense shrublands (Van Dyke, 1978; Holl, 1982; Locke, 2003); \u201cdoghair\u201d forest regeneration (Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Layne, 1987); and riparian areas (Van Dyke, 1978; Tilton and Willad, 1982; Smith, 1985; Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Layne, 1987). Holl (1982) defined the species\u2019 maximum shrub cover threshold as 30%.\r\n\r\nHabitats used by the bighorn sheep include: talus and rock outcrops (Van Dyke, 1978; Tilton and Willard, 1982; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007); alpine tundra (Johnson, 1980; Demarchi et al., 2000); grass/forb patches and meadows (Oldemeyer et al., 1971; Demarchi and Mitchell, 1973; Van Dyke, 1978; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Layne, 1987; Demarchi et al., 2000; Beecham et al., 2007); krummholz (Johnson, 1980; Demarchi et al., 2000); subalpine woodlands (Johnson, 1980); pinyon-juniper woodlands (Greenwood et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999); ponderosa pine savanna and open woodlands (Layne, 1987; Smith et al., 1989; Brundige and McCabe, 1986); open desert shrubland, such as those dominated by ocotillo and brittle-bush (Krausman et al., 1989); Mojave desert shrub (Smith, 1985); open mountain shrubs (Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985); shrub steppe (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Beecham et al., 2007); and burned shrubland or forest, where few snags remain (Etchberger et al., 1991; Greenwood et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999). Habitats specifically avoided by the bighorn sheep include: roads and other developed areas (Demarchi, 2004; Bleich et al., 2008); dense shrubland (Van Dyke, 1978; Smith, 1985; Smith et al., 1999; Locke, 2003); forest (Van Dyke, 1978; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985); and woodlands with depauperate understories (Layne, 1987).\r\n\r\nThat the bighorn sheep\u2019s distribution is restricted to areas near escape terrain is undisputed; however, both the definition of escape terrain and the species\u2019 proximity restrictions are defined differently across studies. Escape terrain has been defined with minimum slopes ranging from 20% (USFWS, 2000) to 200% (Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985). Bighorn sheep\u2019s maximum distance to escape terrain has been documented as ranging from 80 m (Brundige and McCabe, 1986) to 800 m (USFWS, 2000). Across a number of studies, the median documented minimum slope for escape terrain was 60%, with a mean of 77%; the median documented maximum distance from escape terrain was 300 m, with a mean of 281 m (Oldemeyer et al., 1971; Tilton and Willard, 1982; Risenhoover and Bailey, 1985; Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Layne, 1987; Wakelyn, 1987; Arnett, 1990; Smith, 1992; Dunn, 1996; Jalkotzy, 2000; McKinney et al., 2003; Demarchi, 2004; IDFG, 2010). Some authors have defined additional restrictions on the definition of escape terrain, such as only rocky substrates (Brundige and McCabe, 1986; Beecham et al., 2007) and minimum patch sizes (Tilton, 1977; Armentrout and Brigham, 1988; McKinney et al., 2003). Suggested minimum patch sizes range from 1.6 to 2 km.\r\n\r\n\u201cEscape terrain\u201d is an arbitrary concept, reflecting the bighorn sheep\u2019s general preference for higher slopes. When outside of what is classified as escape terrain, the sheep still are more likely to be found on steeper slopes (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Bristow, 1997; Locke, 2003; Bangs et al., 2005; Beecham et al., 2007; Bleich et al., 2008) and are rarely found on slopes <10% (Tilton and Willard, 1982; Smith, 1985; Beecham et al., 2007).\r\n\r\nIn the conterminous U.S., bighorn sheep have been documented from elevations below sea level (Welles and Welles, 1961) to 4300 m (Beecham et al., 2007).\r\n\r\nWhile some suggest that the species is restricted by proximity to water (Demarchi, 2004; Bleich et al., 2010), others have documented occurrences up to 16 km from open water (USFWS, 2000), and others have found the species to occur farther from water than random points in the study area (Bleich et al., 2008) or have found no signification association with water (Bristow, 1997; Cain, 2006).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBISHx", "ELCode": "AMALE04010", "scientific_name": "Ovis canadensis", "ITIS_TSN": "180711", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102557", "common_name": "Bighorn Sheep"}}
