They are essentially terrestrial but sometimes enter slow, shallow streams and creek pools.  \r\n\r\nFrom SWReGAP\r\nPrimarily a prairie turtle (Stebbins 1985, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Over much of its range it inhabits treeless plains and gently rolling country grown to grass or scattered low bushes where soil is sandy (Stebbins 1985, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Also occurs in open woodland (Stebbins 1985).  Listed as Appendix II Species (Export Permit required) (Hammerson 1999).  T. ornata are not dependent on free water (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Are most abundant in grasslands with soils suitable for burrowing (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Box turtles consistently chose microhabitats with lower moisture and soil temperature but higher ambient temperatures than those at the Meterological Station (Nieuwolt 1996). Normally don't occupy elevations above 2100 m (Degenhardt et al. 1996). The elevation range is 0-2,200m (Stebbins 1985, Degenhardt et al. 1996). T. ornata occurs in southeastern Arizona (Stebbins 2003). It is found in eastern Colorado (Hammerson 1999, Stebbins 2003). It is present in New Mexico except in the northwest (Degenhardt et al. 1996, Stebbins 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rOBTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAD08020", "scientific_name": "Terrapene ornata", "ITIS_TSN": "173778", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102021", "common_name": "Ornate Box Turtle"}}
