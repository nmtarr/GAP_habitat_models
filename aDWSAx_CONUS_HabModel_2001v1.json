Typical habitat includes swamps, spring seeps, and bottomland hardwood forest and they also may be abundant at the edges of ponds or bays.  This salamander occurs in wet sites in pine savanna (Martof et al. 1980).  Logs and other heavy objects near the edge of surface water are ideal sites for shelter, but minimal cover such as pine-needle litter or moss in or adjacent to water is usable as well (Petranka 1998).  They rarely wander overland (Bancroft et al 1983).  In xeric hammocks they must burrow or utilize others' burrows to survive dry periods (Ashton 1988).   They lay eggs in seepage areas or near the edges of shallow ponds on the undersides of logs or leaves, under or on sphagnum or pine needles, or on rootlets beneath logs.  They lay up to about 60 eggs singly or in small clusters, late fall to early winter.  The female attends eggs.  Larvae hatch in 30-40 days and metamorphose in spring or early summer. They reach sexual maturity in the first year.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aDWSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05090", "scientific_name": "Eurycea quadridigitata", "ITIS_TSN": "173695", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105209", "common_name": "Dwarf Salamander"}}
