This cottontail occupies a wide variety of habitats and is common in brush, rank weeds, and grassy areas (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Colorado, it inhabits lowland riparian situtations on the eastern plains and lower foothills and is the typical cottontail of cultivated areas of the Colorado Piedmont (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The eastern cottontail in Arizona is most often found in the mountains and adjacent slopes (Hoffmeister 1986). In the southern part of the state, it is frequently in the higher parts of the mountains (Hoffmeister 1986). It lives in interior chaparral, encinal, juniper-pinyon woodland, Mexican oak-pine woodland, and oak and mesquite with some grass (Hoffmeister 1986). In the southeastern mountains S. floridanus has even been sighted among grasses, fir, and aspen (Hoffmeister 1986).  The species may be found in brushy areas, open woodlands, swampy areas, stream valleys, grasslands, and suburbs (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). It is usually absent from boreal habitats and dense woods (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). In the western part of their range, these cottontails are common in grassy areas of the oak woodlands, especially along streams and washes (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992). The home range size ranges from 0.95 to 2.8 hectares (Chapman et al. 1980). The elevation range is from 910 to 2,896 meters (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). S. floridanus is found from the Hualapai to the White mountains and on various southeastern mountains in Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). The species is present in eastern Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs in the more southern mountains and eastern New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). S. floridanus may be found in the following mountain ranges: Hualapai Mountains; White Mountains; Peloncillo Mountains; Animas Mountains; Dog Mountains; Hachet Mountains; Carrizalillo Mountains; Animas Mountains.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nEastern cottontails are highly adaptable and occur in many open, brushy environments. They can be found in a wide variety of habitats from coastal marshes of the barrier islands to mountain farmlands and open forests (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Thickets of various kinds in broken forest or open landscapes appear to support greatest the largest populations (Brown 1997).  They are also seen in the residential areas of most city suburbs, particularly near less populated landscapes or where vacant lots of wooded or brushy growth are present (Webster et al. 1985).  They are usually absent from boreal habitats, dense woods, and from the wetter habitats of the swamp and marsh rabbit (Brown 1997). They do not dig burrows and nests are usually in shallow depressions in thick vegetation. Their average home range is 1-3 ha. (Chapman et al. 1980).  They are very prolific with several litters of 3-6 produced throughout much of the year.  Gestation lasts about a month. Sexual maturity is reached in 2-3 months.\r\n\r\nNortheast:\r\nThis species is endemic to all areas of the northeast with the exception of New England. Prior to 1930, the only endemic cottontail in the New England states was Sylvilagus transitionalis (New England cottontail) (Litvaitis et al. 1997). S. floridanus was imported by private hunting clubs into CT, MA, and perhaps VT, and subsequently has expanded its range through southern and central New England including Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket. The species was apparently present throughout Long Island as early/late as the 1920's based on GBIF records from Southold Township in Suffolk County, NY. In Maryland, Rosa multiflora hedgerows are heavily used by eastern cottontails along with forest edges and strip vegetation (Morgan and Gates 1983). In Ohio, preferred habitats include patches of briars, vine entanglements, brush piles, and small conifers (Boyd 1986). In Connecticut, this species prefers brushpiles for shelter and resting (especially during winter) while areas of exposed shrubby and herbaceous vegetation are required for browsing (Dalke 1942, Chapman et al. 1980). In the Hudson Valley of New York, eastern cottontails utilize grasslands, hedgerows, areas of low, dense brush, and in particular, old fields interspersed with briar thicket edges (Chapman et al. 1980).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nS. floridanus is not native to the Pacific Northwest but has since become established in a handful of localities across WA and OR. The species was introduced into Oregon's Benton County from Ohio in 1937 and Linn County from Illinois in 1941 and has subsequently spread throuhgout the Willamette Valley at least as far north as Portland. However, this population does not range into the foothills of either the Coast or Cascade Ranges bordering the valley (Graf 1955, Verts and Carrawy 1998). Individuals suspected of originating from Kansas were introduced to Umatilla County (Dalquest 1941, Verts and Carraway 1998). In Washington, animals originating from Missouri were imported in 1933 to Battle Ground east of the Columbia River in the southwestern part of the state. It was also introduced to Whitman, Clark, Cowlitz, King, Kittitas, and Skagit Counties as well as Whidbey and Lopez Islands and has since spread widely (Ingles 1965).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains/Upper Midwest:\r\nIn Texas, the eastern cottontail inhabits brushlands and marginal areas, brushy pasture edges, well-drained streamsides and occasionally bottomlands along with the swamp rabbit. Densities can be quite high along coastal prairies (Schmidly 2004). In the Big Bend region it occurs in creosotebush, prickly pear, tarbush, mesquite, and ocotillo communities (Denyes 1956). In Michigan, periennial grasses and mixed herbaceous habitats were preferred. Highest abundances were recorded in farmlands abandoned for at least four to six years. Abundance decreased as succession provided larger, more numerous trees with higher canopy cover and lower amounts of shrubby ground cover (Beckwith 1954). In Minnesota, this species is associated with dense woody vegetation and brush piles, particularly among shelterbelts, strip vegetation, fencerows, and roadsides (Swihart et al. 1982). In western South Dakota,  eastern cottontails are associated with\r\nblack-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies due to the presence of higher vegetative diversity around colonies than in the surrounding prairie (Sharps et al. 1990). Populations have been declining for decades in the Plains and Midwest states. Between 1956 and 1978, eastern cottontails have decreased 70% (Edwards et al. 1979). In Ohio, populations declined 70% statewide from 1956 to 1983, and 90% to 95%  in intensively farmed areas (Boyd 1986). Declines are attributed to conversion of crop types from oats and hay to corn and wheat, conversion of native tallgrass fescue to agriculture and general intensity of agricultural practices (Edwards et al. 1979, Boyd 1986, Guiliano 1990). The GBIF (2014) database contain almost 4400 geolocated records for this species, more than 62% are dated 1978 or earlier.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mEACOx", "ELCode": "AMAEB01040", "scientific_name": "Sylvilagus floridanus", "ITIS_TSN": "180124", "Global_SEQ_ID": "791124", "common_name": "Eastern Cottontail"}}
