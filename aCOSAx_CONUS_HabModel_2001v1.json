More recently, this species has been described from northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, and extreme southeastern British Columbia (Corkran and Thoms 1996; Wilson and Ohanjanian 2002). Elevational range is between 500and 1550 meters (Green et al. 2013). Stebbins has reported an elevational range of 488 to 1524 meters. It is characterized as rare, but may possibly be abundant in localized pockets (Wilson and Ohanjanian 2002). Habitat associated with adults include semi-aquatic situations like seepages, splash zones, and streamside talus (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Lynch 1984), but also in damp talus and forest debris (Slater and Slipp 1940).Found in 3 major types of habitats springs/seeps, waterfall spray zones and edges of streams.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCOSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12270", "scientific_name": "Plethodon idahoensis", "ITIS_TSN": "173659", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100555", "common_name": "Coeur D'alene Salamander"}}
