It was falsely reported in Arizona (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Bradley et al. (2015) present evidence that this species\u2019 classification should be revised and recommends renaming the species to P. laceianus.   \r\n\r\nThis species\u2019 distribution seems to be more related to the presence of rocky areas than to vegetative community (Schmidley 1994).  It likes rocky outcropping and rocky bluffs along rivers and creeks (Davis and Schmidly 1997), and in the lowlands, it is common in rocky arroyos and boulder-strewn draws (Geluso 2004).  It has been documented in oak-juniper communities, rock walls, talus slopes, riparian woodlands, rocky outcroppings, in buildings, and rocky bluffs (Schmidley 1994), as well as communities composed of dwarfed, shrubby junipers, desert sumac, pinyon -juniper, redberry juniper, oaks, shinnery oak sandscrub, white-thorn ocotillo, lechuguilla, agarito, sotol, beargrass, broom snakeweed, fragrant sumac, littleleaf sumac, prickly pear, cane cholla, mariola, acacia, lovegrass, grama, and buffalograss  (Findley et al. 1975, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Geluso 2004). It is also found in chihuahuan desertscrub (Thompson et al. 1996), grama-bluestem, catclaw, and oak-juniper (Schmidly 1974, Davis and Schmidly 1997).  It is found up to 1,951 meters above sea level (Geluso 2004). N.
