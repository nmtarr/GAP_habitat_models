A separate population is distributed in north central Alabama, neighboring Tennessee and Mississippi, small patch in north Georgia and nearby south east Tennessee and southwest North Carolina (Conant and Collins 1998). Current distribution is much reduced from its historical records; now, its range is mainly the Appalachian Plateau Physiographic Province from central and western Pennsylvania to southwestern Georgia, central Alabama, and northeastern Mississippi (Hoffman 1980).\r\n\r\nHabitats of preference are hilly areas of woodlands (Behler and King 1979). Other preferred habitats are forested slopes and hilltops of an elevation of at least 1100 meters. Found often far from bodies of water. Breeding takes place in shallow, small pools in woods or their edges. Also, associated with pools and ditches that form downflow of hillside springs (Conant and Collins 1998). Also, furrows of plowed fields, pools in roadruts, mountaintop bogs, seepages, temporary pools, and woodland springs. Breeding occurs in shallow water of wetlands found from 365-1341m (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\n610m movement with season and 1219m movement between breeding seasons (Green 1952 in Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aMCFRx", "ELCode": "AAABC05010", "scientific_name": "Pseudacris brachyphona", "ITIS_TSN": "173528", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104655", "common_name": "Mountain Chorus Frog"}}
