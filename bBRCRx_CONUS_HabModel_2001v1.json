They are primarily a bird of coniferous forests, but utilize other forest types as well, especially when there are large or dead trees present (Hejl et al. 2002).  Creepers forage up the trunks and limbs of trees, starting at the base, searching crevices in the bark for small insects, larvae, and insect eggs (Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996).  Their nest is commonly placed behind bark scales (Potter et al. 1980) or a loose piece (Hamel 1992) or large strip (Kaufman 1996) of bark still attached to the tree. Ehrlich et al. (1988) described it as a 'hammocklike cup.'  Knotholes and natural cavities are also known locations for nests (Potter et al 1980).  Nests are usually between 5 and 15 feet above the ground (Harrison 1975).  \r\n\r\nIn the southeastern U.S., Brown Creepers breed mostly in the high altitude forests of the Appalachian Mountains (Potter et al 1980).  They breed in mature forests of spruce and/or fir, or where spruce or fir are mixed with hardwoods (Hamel 1992). Occasionally they breed in hemlock or white pine forests (Hamel 1992, Simpson 1992).       \r\n\r\nIn the northeastern U.S., Brown Creepers use most conifer and hardwood forest types, except aspen, as well as bald cypress and tupelo riparian gallery forests and swamps.  In Pennsylvania, they are most abundant in old-growth eastern hemlock stands (Tsuga Canadensis; Hejl et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nIn the eastern U.S., south of the northern conifer zone, populations occur regularly in forested floodplains with bald cypress and tupelo, and sometimes in swamps.  Hamel (1992) suggested that floodplain forests may be important habitat in Michigan, based on his personal experience.  Davis (1978) studied populations in Michigan that inhabited an old white cedar, balsam fir, and black spruce swamp, with components of sugar maple, red maple, white pine, basswood and paper birch and a more topographically varied and drier forest of red maple, American beech, American elm, and white cedar, with small amounts of white oak, eastern hemlock, large-toothed aspen, butternut hickory, and American elm.  He found that all nests were in dead trees and near water. Two were in swamps, while all others were within 60 m of flowing streams.\r\n\r\nIn the western U.S., Brown Creepers are most abundant in mature and old-growth forests with high canopy coverage and large live and dead trees. Their abundance is positively correlated with the presence of very large (>100 cm dbh) Douglas firs.  In the Northwest, Brown Creepers are commonly found in unlogged, old-growth stands (Hejl et al. 2002).  In the Washington Cascades and Oregon Coast Range, they are abundant in Douglas-fir/western hemlock forests but avoid bottomland forests in the Olympics where trees are spread farther apart.  They are rare in Ponderosa pine forests and will inhabit deciduous forests (Hejl et al. 2002).  They are significantly more abundant in mature (80-190 year old) and old growth (>200 year old) stands than in younger stands (Hejl et al. 2002).  Brown Creeper nests have been discovered in Lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, White fir, and Red fir trees at Sagehen Creek Field Station in northern California.  In the central Rocky Mountains, Brown Creepers are most common in mature spruce-fir and lodgepole pine forests between 2,700 and 3,500 m, but they also use Douglas-fir and subalpine spruce-fir (Hejl et al. 2002).  In the Rocky Mountains within Idaho and Montana, Brown Creepers occur in young forests and pine forests, including recently burned forests of Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, and western larch (Larix occidentalis), but they are not as common in these communities as in mature western red cedar (Thuja plicata)-western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), spruce-fir, and mixed-conifer (Hejl et al. 2002). \r\n   \r\nThe southwestern range of the Brown Creeper includes the Guadalupe, Jarbridge, Snake, Sheep, Monitor, Quinn Canyon, Charleston, Mogollon, Sandia, Chuska, Jemez, Sangre de Cristo, Zuni, Mt. Taylor, Sandia, San Francisco, Pinos Altos, Black, White, Sacramento, Animas, and Rocky mountain ranges and they are residents in the mountains of Nevada (SWreGAP).  Their preferred habitats are forests, woodlands, forested floodplains, and swamps, but they are most common in mature spruce-fir and lodgepole communities (Hejl et al. 2002).  Along large rivers, they inhabit dense stands of oak in thickly wooded riparian canyons and dense stands of cottonwood (Populus spp.; Hejl et al. 2002).  They can be found in closed-canopy redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas fir, and tanoak on the central California coast as well as in oak woodlands, broadleaf evergreens, and California bay laurel communities (Umbellularia californica; Hejl et al. 2002).  They are rare in Ponderosa pine forests in California and the central Rockies although they are common in Ponderosa pine forests of New Mexico and Arizona.  In Arizona, they inhabit mixed coniferous forests dominated by Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, and southwest white pine and mixed-conifer forests in high-elevation snowmelt drainages containing quaking aspen and Gambel\u2019s oak (Quercus gambelii).  In Utah, they prefer forested areas at high elevations during the summer, especially old-growth Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), and lower elevation scrublands and woodlands during winter (Hejl et al. 2002).  They also breed in seral subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) in northern Utah but not in seral aspen. Recently burned areas containing snags are used but not as commonly as mature, unburned forests (Hejl et al. 2002).  In the western Sierra Nevada Mountains, they are found in a range of forest types from low-elevation ponderosa pine to high-elevation lodgepole pine, but they prefer mixed-conifer and California red-fir (Abies magnifica) forests (Hefl et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nDuring the breeding season, the altitudinal ranges of Brown Creepers in the western U.S. generally follow conifer forest zones.  Other reported altitudinal ranges are above 1,370 m in North Carolina (Simpson 1992), between 2,300 and 2,700 m in New Mexico, at 1,980 m in Arizona, at 1,000 m in California, up to 2,700 m in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho, and at 3,500 m in Colorado (Hefl et al. 2002).   They occur from sea level to the timberline on the north Pacific Coast, up to 1,050 m on Canada\u2019s Pacific Coast, and from 340 to 1,200 m at inland areas of Canada (Hefl et al. 2002). \r\n\r\nBrown Creeper winter distribution is similar to breeding distribution but the use of deciduous forests, forested urban and suburban areas, and orchards are more widespread during the nonbreeding season (Hefl et al. 2002).  They also often move to lower latitudes and elevations, ranging south to the Gulf Coast (Hefl et al. 2002).  In the SW, they can be found in all types of coniferous forests, aspen and lowland riparian forests, and urban areas but they are rare in pinyon-juniper habitats.  In the lower Colorado Valley, they use mature cottonwood-willow communities and, occasionally, mesquite habitats.  In tree savannas in central North America between northern Texas and the Midwest, they are common in savannas including oak-hickory (Carya) forests with bluestem (Andropogon spp.) at prairie edges (Hefl et al. 2002).  In the Great Plains, they use gallery forests along rivers (Hefl et al. 2002).  They are uncommon in Midwestern shelterbelts (Hefl et al. 2002).  The habitat they use in California is lower in elevation than those used in summer.  They are present in blue oak (Q. douglasii) savannas, dry pine zones, deciduous riparian areas, and Incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens).  In northeastern Oregon, they are present in broadleaf woodlands along major rivers (Hefl et al. 2002).  In the southern Washington Cascades, they are present in Douglas fir/western hemlock forests (Hefl et al. 2002).\r\nN.
