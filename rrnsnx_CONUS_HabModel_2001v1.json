The range comprises areas of Nova Scotia, southern Quebec, southern Ontario, Minnesota, eastern Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota, Arizona, and southeastern Colorado. Also found in the Gulf coast of the United States and southern Florida. The western range includes California, western Oregon, Nevada, southern Washington, Idaho, and Utah. From there, populations extend into Baja California and San Luis Potosi, Mexico as well (Grismer 2002; Natureserve.org; Stebbins 2003). It is still uncertain if populations of the ring-necked snake are well established on Grand Cayman Island (Schwartz and Henderson 1991).\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits forests, grassland, chaparral, woodland, and riparian zones of arid to semiarid ecosystems. Most populations are found in moist habitats. Prolonged periods of inactivity during the day are spent underground, or hiding under rocks, logs, or vegetation. Eggs are also laid underground, or under rocks, logs, and leaf litter (Natureserve.org; Stebbins 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rRNSNx", "ELCode": "ARADB10010", "scientific_name": "Diadophis punctatus", "ITIS_TSN": "174158", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100405", "common_name": "Ring-necked Snake"}}
