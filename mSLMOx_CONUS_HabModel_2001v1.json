It occurs in urban areas, agriculture, barren land, grama \"short-grass\", scrub-grassland, warm temperate swamp and riparian forests, shortgrass plains, sactan grasslands, oak savannah, desert grassland, encinal and Mexican oak-pine woodlands, and semi-arid grassland with sandy soil, frequently near Opuntia or yucca (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). PNV - Douglas-fir - white fir and Great Basin desertscrub (Thompson et al. 1996). The presence of grassy cover may be the most important factor in habitat selection (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). P. flavus needs no water at relative humidities of 20-60% and can survive for months on a diet of dry seeds (Best and Skupski 1994). The species eats Potts' leatherweed, Texas croton, pigweed, goosefoot, phlox, gaura, mustards, and the seeds of Cucurbita, Russian thistle, Chenopodium, fescue, Cryptantha, Amaranthus, Opuntia, and Sphaeralcea (Best and Skupski 1994, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Dipodomys phillipsii shares its burrows with P. flavus (Best and Skupski 1994). P. flavus may use the burrows of D. spectabilis, too (Best and Skupski 1994). It may use old pocket gopher mounds or the nests of Neotoma micropus (Best and Skupski 1994). It occurs at elevations of 975-2,490m (Best and Skupski 1994). The home range size is 0.11ha (Best and Skupski 1994). The average range of movement is 62.5 m; average dispersal distance during its lifetime is 202 m (Best and Skupski 1994). The species forages avoveground when it's as cold as -10 degrees C (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). In Arizona, it lives in desert grasslands where temperatures can be above 40 degrees C in the summer (Best and Skupski 1994). P. flavus is found mainly in eastern Arizona, but not on the Mogollon Plateau (Hoffmeister 1986). It occurs in the eastern plains, the San Luis Valley, and the extreme southwest corner of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species is found throughout New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It occurs only in extreme southeast Utah (Durrant 1952, Zeveloff 1988, Utah GAP 1997).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nThey occupy the semidesert grasslands of the central and southern Great Plains, specializing in burrowing under rock edges, and beneath shrub roots, cacti, and brush. They prefer areas with thin, low grasses, with a minimum amount of bare ground. In eastern Wyoming, they can be found on loamy or claylike soils covered with grama and needlegrasses (Wilson and Ruff 1999). In Texas, Schmidly (2004) describes habitat as: \"more tolerant of habitat conditions than some of the other species of small pocket mice. In some areas they are found in rocky situations; in other on hard, stony soils; and in still others on sands. In most localties however, they occur on mellow soils of valley bottoms where they live among scattered weeds and shrubs and burrow in the sand.\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSLMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFD01030", "scientific_name": "Perognathus flavus", "ITIS_TSN": "180262", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103740", "common_name": "Silky Pocket Mouse"}}
