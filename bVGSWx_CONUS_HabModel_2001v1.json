Utah Conservation Data Center. http://dwrcdc.nr.utah.gov/ucdc/."}, "habitat_description": "In General:\r\nOpen deciduous, coniferous, and mixed woodlands, including ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), Monterey pine (P. radiata), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). In southern part of range, most common at elevations 2,000 to 3,500 m, although also nests in wooded canyons. In the north, breeds at lower elevations and near coast. Shares breeding habitat with Tree Swallow, but often found in more open habitat: rock crevices, holes in dirt banks or in columnar cacti. Thought to benefit from post-fire habitat as this species consistently nests in habitat similar to that expected to result from frequent, low-intensity fire (Purcell and Stephens 2005). Known to depend on \u201clegacy\u201d trees in forests of n. California; these are large trees that survive cutting or other disturbance and often contain cavities for nesting (Mazurek and Zielinski 2004). Sampling birds nesting on cliff faces in Colorado, Rossi and Knight (2006) found highest densities of Violet-green Swallows on the largest cliffs (quoted directly from Brown et al. 2011).\r\nIn California, this species is a common summer resident in most wooded habitats, less common in shrub habitats. Breeds in forest and woodland areas throughout the state, including coastal and desert ranges, from coastal woodlands to pine forests (especially at middle elevations). Also breeds on cliffs and rock formations with suitable crevices in desert regions. Feeds over fields,\r\nlakes and streams, and over forests and woodlands. Shows a preference for feeding over\r\nbodies of water (quoted directly from Green et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nJewett (1953) reported Violet-green Swallows in w. Washington principally around settlements and on the prairie; in e. Washington in the coulee country of the Big Bend, the bunch-grass, and wheat-growing area, especially the open timbered regions of the Upper Transition Zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nOpen coniferous, deciduous or mixed forest and woodland, primarily in highlands (NatureServe 2004). Common in Utah during summer, it resides in a variety of habitats, ranging from lowland valleys to mountain peaks, but typically it breeds in mid elevation aspen forests where it can find an abundance of abandoned woodpecker cavities in which to nest (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). Common in ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, aspen forests (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Shares breeding habitat with Tree Swallow, but often found in more open habitat - rock crevices, holes in dirt banks, or, in Mexico, columnar cacti (Brown et al. 1992). Common swallow of mountain forests, where it nests in holes in tall, dead trees (Phillips et al. 1994). Breeds mostly in aspen forests, around cliffs, and in towns but also in coniferous and montane riparian forests and in embankments (Andrews and Righter 1992). Nevada: summer resident mostly in mountains and transient elsewhere (Alcorn 1988). Inhabits coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests, preferring open or broken woods or edges of dense woodlands (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Generally associated with open coniferous forests, but also breeds in aspen groves, riparian woods, and in urbanized areas (Johnsgard 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bVGSWx", "ELCode": "ABPAU03040", "scientific_name": "Tachycineta thalassina", "ITIS_TSN": "178427", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100465", "common_name": "Violet-green Swallow"}}
