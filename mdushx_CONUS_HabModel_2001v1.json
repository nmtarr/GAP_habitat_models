The species prefers moist streamside communities (Thompson et al. 1996).  It has been found among boulders and talus; in damp meadows of thick, often tall grass with ponderosa pine or spruce-fir nearby; on mossy banks of small meandering streams; in wet meadows; alpine tundra; pinyon-juniper; sagebrush; spruce forests; and in marshy and clearcut areas (Thompson et al. 1996, Zeveloff 1998, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Dense herbaceous or woody groundcover is preferred (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It has also been collected in relatively dry subalpine meadow and coniferous forest edge (Fitzgerald 1994).  S. monticolus occurs among aspen, cottonwood - willow, alder, black walnut, maple, Chihuahuan pine, silverleaf oak, Engelmann's spruce, Douglas-fir, white fir, ponderosa pine, bristlecone pine, limber pine, Shasta red fir, California red fir, lodgepole pine, western larch, western hemlock, red alder, bigleaf maple, Jeffrey pine, closed pinyon and juniper, salal, and sycamore (Findley et al. 1975, Hoffmeister 1986, Zeveloff 1988, Hall 1995, Smith and Belk 1996, Thompson et al. 1996).  In California, it is common in montane riparian and alpine dwarf-shrub habitats; fairly common in subalpine conifer, wet meadow, and high-elevation fresh emergent wetland habitats; and uncommon in ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, red fir, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, annual grass, and perennial grasslands (Zeiner et al. 2008).  Riparian and wet meadow habitats within Jeffrey pine, red fir, and lodgepole pine forests are preferred (Zeiner et al. 2008).  \r\nThe home range size is 0.61ha (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The elevation ranges from 915-3,506m (Hoffmeister 1986, Zeveloff 1988).  S. monticolus occurs on the Mogollon Plateau, on San Francisco Peak, and in the Chuska, Pinaleno, Santa Catalina, White, and Chiricahua mountains of Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986, Smith and Belk 1996, Demboski and Cook 2001).  It is found in western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Smith and Belk 1996, Demboski and Cook 2001).  It occurs in northeastern Nevada and the western corner of the state (Smith and Belk 1996, Demboski and Cook 2001). The species occurs in the majority of mountains west of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, as well as the Manzano, Sandia, and Sangre de Cristo mountains (Demboski and Cook 2001, Frey 2004). It is found in the mountains of northern and central Utah, and in the Abajo Mountains in the southeast (Smith and Belk 1996, Utah GAP 1997, Demboski and Cook 2001).  Alexander (1996) recognized S. m. neomexicanus as a separate species, S. neomexicanus.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mDUSHx", "ELCode": "AMABA01080", "scientific_name": "Sorex monticolus", "ITIS_TSN": "179950", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101738", "common_name": "Dusky Shrew"}}
