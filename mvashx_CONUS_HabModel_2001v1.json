There is a relict population isolated in central Mexico (Gillihan and Foresman 2004).  In the SWReGAP region, this species occurs only in Nevada and Utah.  It occurs in western, northern and east-central Nevada (Hall 1995; Gillihan and Foresman 2004) and it occurs in Utah from the Raft River Mountains in the northwest, south to the Deep Creek Mountains, and east to the Wasatch Mountains (Rickart 2001; Gillihan and Foresman 2004). \r\n\r\nThe vagrant shrew occurs in a variety of vegetation systems across its range but it is most commonly known from streamsides and mesic meadows.  It has been captured in alpine tundra, bunchgrass, wet meadows, grassy meadows, riparian zones, swamps, bogs, forest openings, and coniferous forests of Douglas-fir, mountain hemlock, montane spruce, and ponderosa pine.  In the central Great Basin, it is most abundant at lower elevations; however, where its sister species (Sorex monticolus) is absent, the vagrant shrew is found in local abundance in montane and subalpine systems that would otherwise be occupied by S. monticolus (Rickart 2001; Rickart, pers. Comm., 2005).  Where the two species are sympatric, they are rarely caught at the same trap (Hennings and Hoffman 1977).  Sorex vagrans occurs in the absence of S. monticolus in the Raft River and Deep Creek mountains of Utah, and in the Ruby and Snake Ranges of Nevada (Rickart 2001).  At lower elevations, this species is typically found in moist, grassy areas, such as along ditches, streams, lakesides, salt and freshwater marshes, bogs, wet meadows, and springs; in some locations it is found at higher elevations in mesic coniferous forests such as with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), grand fir (Abies grandis), red cedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga tsuga), and western larch (Larix occidentalis); in the Columbia Basin, it has been found along streams within grasslands, sagebrush (Artemisia)- steppe, and ponderosa pine forest (Hooven et al. 1975; Whitaker and Maser 1976; Hennings and Hoffman 1977; Terry 1981; Morrison and Anthony 1989; Carey and Johnson 1995; Findley 1999).  \r\n\r\nIn the SWReGAP region it has been found in Utah in salt grass (Distichlis spicata) playa (Cramer et al. 1990; Rickart, pers. Comm, 2004), shallow, dry ravines in the West Desert (Cramer et al. 1990), and in streams, lake sides, and wetlands in and along the Wasatch Mountains (derived from specimen localities listed in Hennings and Hoffman 1977).  It was found in the Raft River mountains of Utah in grassy meadows, stream banks, and near beaver ponds (Berryman 1946).  In Nevada it has been found in streamsides and marsh meadows with salt grass, wirerushes (Juncus spp.), bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), sedges (Carex spp.), and/or various grasses (O'Farrell and Clark 1986, Ports and Ports 1989; Hall 1995). It is also known from an Englemann spruce (Picea engelmannii) forest in the Snake Range (Rickart et al. 2004), a mountain range where S. monticolus is absent.  Local occurrence patterns of the vagrant shrew are likely influenced by the presence of S. monticolus (Rickart, pers. Comm., 2005).  However, SWReGAP methods were unable to account for this due to the use of HUCs to delineate range, where one HUC could encompass both areas where the two species occur singly and areas where they are sympatric.  Therefore, the model likely overpredicts habitat in coniferous forests; this mostly impacts the predicted distribution in the Wasatch range but also small areas in the ranges of northern Nevada.\r\n\r\nSome individuals collected in Utah and Nevada were from 1280 m (Hennings and Hoffman 1977) to 3383 m (Hall 1995). In California the species is found from sea level to 3750 m (CA-DFG 2003), and in British Columbia it has been found at up to 2,133 m (Gillihan and Foresman 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mVASHx", "ELCode": "AMABA01070", "scientific_name": "Sorex vagrans", "ITIS_TSN": "179932", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106262", "common_name": "Vagrant Shrew"}}
