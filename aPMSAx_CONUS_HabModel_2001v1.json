Although limited in range, they are locally abundant, inhabiting rocky slopes in hardwood or mixed hardwood forest, where they are usually found within moist rock crevices.  Found at elevations between 225 and 600 m (Natureserve April 15, 2005).  They are frequently seen around cave entrances, and have also been observed under logs and under leaf litter in the vicinity of rock outcrops.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aPMSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12310", "scientific_name": "Plethodon petraeus", "ITIS_TSN": "208291", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106370", "common_name": "Pigeon Mountain Salamander"}}
