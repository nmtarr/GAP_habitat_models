Other localities include Erskine Creek Canyon, which is a tributary to Kern River on the northern region of the neighboring Piute Mountains where they have been reported in small trees at elevations from 890 to 1220 meters. Stebbins (2003) reports an elevational range of up to 1920 meters.\r\nHabitat utilized by this species includes north-facing slopes of pine-oak woodlands along tributary canyons and ravines. Plants that are found in these areas include interior live oak, sycamore, foothill pine, Fremont cottonwood, willow, and California buckeye. Some of the understory vegetation includes nettles, miner\u2019s lettuce, poison oak, Nemophilia species, Phacelia sp., and grasses. It is important to note that salamanders have been found in both, wet margins of seepages and creeks and exposed hillsides in chaparral vegetation (Brame and Murray 1968; Hansen 1988). \r\nIn Clear Creek by Miracle Hot Springs at 685 meters of elevation, salamanders were reported in the slopes covered with interior live oak, foothill pine, yucca, beavertail cactus, and California juniper. In Erskine Creek Canyon at 890-1220 meters, salamanders were associated with foothill pine, canyon live oak, interior live oak, manzanita, deer brush, and Great Basin sagebrush (Lannoo 2005). \r\n\r\nSalamanders were associated with foothill pine, canyon live oak, interior live oak, manzanita, deer brush, and Great Basin sagebrush (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aKCSSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD02080", "scientific_name": "Batrachoseps simatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173710", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100572", "common_name": "Kern Canyon Slender Salamander"}}
