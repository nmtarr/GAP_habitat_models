The rainbow snake is found in association to creeks, and low gradient medium sized rivers, but primarily characterized by shallow water. The more terrestrial associations occur in forested and herbaceous wetlands. Its habitat includes swamps, springs, open marshes, and brackish tidal areas. Hibernaculum also takes place in uplands near water (Dundee and Rossman 1989; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Mount 1975; Palmer and Braswell 1995).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Cover includes soil, leaf litter, decaying logs, wet debris, and mats of vegetation nearby water bodies.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rRASNx", "ELCode": "ARADB14020", "scientific_name": "Farancia erytrogramma", "ITIS_TSN": "174166", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105967", "common_name": "Rainbow Snake"}}
