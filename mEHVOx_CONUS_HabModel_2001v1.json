However, currently the two are regarded as separate taxa by Jones et al. (1997), Baker et al. (2003), Wilson and Reeder (1999, 2005), Wilson and Ruff (1999), and NatureServe. This species only occurs in an extreme northern section of Minnesota where it is generally found in relatively dry, open coniferous forest heath understory. Less commonly, it will inhabit shrubby forest or wet meadow edges. Eastern heather vole diet consists of shrub barks, berries, leaves, seeds, fungus, and lichens. Foods are stored at the entrance of burrows which are typically under shrubs, rocks, root stumps, or fallen logs (Wilson and Ruff 1999).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mEHVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF10050", "scientific_name": "Phenacomys ungava", "ITIS_TSN": "552492", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103453", "common_name": "Eastern Heather Vole"}}
