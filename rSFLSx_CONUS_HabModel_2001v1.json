The areas this species occupies within this range are dominated by forested wetland, but also sand dunes, shrubland, chaparral, and various woodland types.\r\n\r\nThe preferred habitat of this species includes wet pine flatwoods, cypress heads, scrub and sandhill (high pine) habitats, well drained sandy places, seashore islands, cutover woodlots, ridgetops, and abandoned buildings (Anderson and Tiebout 1993; Mushinsky 1992). This species is described primarily as terrestrial and arboreal, but with close ties to cover underground, in or using soil, leaf litter, fallen logs, standing snag, and hollow trees. Mushinsky (1992) and Anderson and Tiebout (1993) have reported ground litter, logs, piles of wood, and stumps as important opportunities for shelter and cover. Furthermore, the eggs are laid in logs or under rocks.\r\n\r\nCover includes soil, rocks, leaf litter, piles of wood, and logs.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSFLSx", "ELCode": "ARACH01070", "scientific_name": "Plestiodon inexpectatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173960", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105537", "common_name": "Southeastern Five-lined Skink"}}
