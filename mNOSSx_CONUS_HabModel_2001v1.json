They can also be found in bogs, marshes, near backwaters and inlets, hydric hammocks, flatwoods, and salt marshes (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Other potential habitats for these shrews include brushy areas, woodlands, grasslands, old fields, fencerows, dry uplands, and thickets, provided they are sufficiently moist.  This shrew is typically found where soil moisture is capable of maintaining humidity in the shrew's burrow at a consistently high level (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Consequently, this shrew is more restricted to moister wooded habitats in the southern portions of its range.  In New England, occurs in nearly all habitats.  Frequents wooded areas, along the banks of small streams (Godin 1977).  They dig tunnels or use existing ones and construct elaborate underground nest.  The normal home range of this species probably is about 50 yards in diameter and covers about 0.4 acres (Burt 1940).  They mainly breed in early February-March through September with peaks occurring in spring and late summer or early fall.  Gestation is three weeks. Litter size is 3-10 (average 4-6) with three or more litters per year.  They reach sexual maturity in 1-2 months.  Stacy Smith, 12June05 & N.
