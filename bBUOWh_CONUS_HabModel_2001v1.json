Numerous subspecies of Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) occur in South America, but only two are found in North America: A.c. hypugaea in the West and A. c. floridana in Florida.  Burrowing Owls are year-round residents in southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, southern California, Florida, and the Bahamas.  They winter in southern Mexico (Haug et al. 1993).  Northern breeding Western Burrowing Owl\u2019s migrate to the southwestern states.  \r\n\r\nBurrowing owls are reported to be forage generalists and consume mostly insects in the summer and vertebrates such as small mammals in the winter over all parts of the range (Haug and Millsap 1993).  They inhabit open, treeless areas with short vegetation such as well-drained grasslands, prairies, steppes, deserts, barrier islands (Texas), and agricultural lands (AGFD 2001).  They sometimes occur in developed areas such as suburban housing developments, golf courses, cemeteries, roadsides, airports, vacant urban lots, and fairgrounds (Ray et al. 2011).  Florida Burrowing Owls can be found in places where 25-75% of the landscape is developed as residential or industrial (Ray et al. 2011). \r\n\r\nSite characteristics for these areas inhabited by the Burrowing Owl tend to be level, open, and have dry vegetation typical in heavily grazed or low stature grasslands or desert vegetation (Johnsgard 1988). These habitats are often in close association with burrowing mammals (e.g. prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.), fox (Vulpes spp.), and badger (Taxidea taxus) excavations) in whose abandoned den the Burrowing Owls make their nest (Haug et al. 1993, NatureServe 2004). Nest microhabitats include open, dry, treeless area typically occupied by burrowing mammals that provide nest burrows, and rangelands grazed by burrowing mammals and domestic livestock, which maintain short vegetation (McDonald et al. 2004).  Consistent features found in burrowing owl nest site studies include high densities of available burrows for nesting; active or very recently abandoned prairie dog colonies; close proximity to other nesting burrowing owls; close proximity to occupied prairie dog burrows; short vegetation around nest burrow; low shrub density, and high forb density; and presence of dried manure for lining of nest burrow (McDonald et al. 2004).  Presence of burrows in developed areas seems to be a critical habitat requirement for the Burrowing Owl (Haug et. al. 1993).  \r\n\r\nIn the Great Basin, the Burrowing Owl can be found occupying shrub steppe habitats with open to dense stands of shrubs and low trees (Ryser 1985, BISON-M). The plant communities in this ecological system include big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate), saltbrush (Atriplex confertifolia), greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus), or creosote bush (Larrea divaricata) (BISON-M). In southern New Mexico, the Burrowing Owl occupies areas of Chihuahuan desert scrub and grasslands (BISON-M). The plant communities in these ecological systems include creosote, mesquite (Prosopis spp.), succulents, and black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), and alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides) (BISON-M).\r\n\r\nAgriculture and construction sites appear to be sink habitat for burrowing owls.  In southern California pesticide applications in agricultural areas likely affect the reproductive success of birds that breed in agricultural environments.  Eggs in 1997 were 22% thinner than eggs prior to 1937 in this study and pesticides were detected in feather pins and on the feet of owls (Gervais et al. 2000).  Tilling of agricultural fields also destroys nests, lowers reproductive success and increases predation (Haug 1985).  Open soil or sand areas associated with development are reported to be correlated with significantly lower reproductive success (Millsap and Bear 1988).\r\n\r\nThe Burrowing Owl occurs at varying elevations throughout the southwest. In Arizona, this owl can be found occupying habitats between 198-1873m; New Mexico\u2019s population is found at habitats between 854-2135m; and Colorado\u2019s populations are found between 914-2743m (Schrupp and Cade 1989, AGFD 2001, BISON-M).\r\n\r\nIn winter, they roost in burrows that were used for nesting as well as in other ground-level cavities including road culverts, construction pipes, artificial burrows, rubble/rock piles, and tufts of vegetation (Ray et al. 2011).
