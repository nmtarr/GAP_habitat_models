During the day, this species is found under rocks, debris, or similar surface cover. Also under decaying logs and stumps. At night, it wanders into onto roads. Eggs are usually laid in rotting logs, underground, sawdust piles, under woody debris (Natureserve.org). Populations are generally found in dry and wooded pine or oak woodland, containing an abundance of rocks, logs, and decaying stumps. Habitats can be located on hillsides and ridges, sandy pine flatwoods, maritime forests, sandhills, mesic meadows, hardwood hammocks, and margins of swamps, marshes, and rivers (Ashton and Ashton 1981; Barbour 1971; Dundee and Rossman 1989; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Minton 2001; Mitchell 1994; Mount 1975; Palmer and Braswell 1995; Tennant 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\nSE-\tPlant communities are often characteristic of xeric pine woodland, mesic meadows, oak woodland, and hardwood hammocks.
