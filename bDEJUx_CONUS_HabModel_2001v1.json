The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA."], "habitat_description": "The Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) is a species that includes 15 subspecies which exhibit marked variation in traits within and among the subspecies (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  The recognized subspecies at the time of this model\u2019s creation are J. h. hyemalis, J. h. carolinensis, J. h. cismontanus, J. h. oreganus, J. h. shufeldti, J. h. montanus, J. h. thurberi, J. h. pinosus, J. h. pontilis, J. h. townsendi, J. h. mearnsi, J. h. caniceps, J. h. dorsalis, J. h. aikeni, J. h. insularis, and these species are recognized as belonging to one of five groups; The Hyemalis Group (Slate-colored Junco), the Oreganus Group (Oregon Junco), the Caniceps Group (Gray-headed Junco), the Aikeni Group (White-winged Junco), and the Insularis Group (Guadalupe Junco; Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nDark-eyed Juncos breed in a variety of woodland, forest, edge, and open vegetative communities throughout the U.S.  They place their nests on sloping ground where it is hidden by ferns or grass, or in a rock crevice (Potter et al. 1980).  Sometimes nests are above ground in fallen tree roots, or in a shrub or conifer up to 40 feet high (Tanner 1958).  \r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire, Dark-eyed Juncos inhabit subalpine boreal forests, unfragmented mid- to late-stage hardwood forests with dense understory and ground cover, and rocky slopes with moderate exposure, where they are most abundant (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  One study in Minnesota failed to find them in 73-yr-old deciduous-coniferous forests, but did find them in this same habitat types after trees were reduced by 50% (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nIn the southeastern U.S., Dark-eyed Juncos breed in the upper elevations of the southern Appalachians (Alsop 1991, Potter et al 1980), where they are reported to breed in all habitat types within their range including all stages of deciduous and coniferous forests, the understory or shrub layer of mature forests, and balds of grass or heath (Simpson 1992, Nicholson 1997).  \r\n\r\nIn the Black Hills of South Dakota, they are most abundant in pine (Pinus spp.) forests at =1,525 m and in dry forests dominated by spruce (Picea sp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), pine, and fir (Abies spp.) from 1,830 to 3,050\u20133,415 m (timberline) and in pure aspen, poplar, cottonwood (Populus), and mountain mahogony (Cereocarpus) stands and their edges, while avoiding unshaded forest floors (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  They are also found in brushy hollows, canyons, and gulches (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  Near Corvallis, OR, wintering Dark-eyed Juncos were found in 80 to 120-yr-old thinned Douglas-fir forests and were absent from un-logged areas where they bred.  They were densest where tree volume was reduced by 75% (Nolan Jr. et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nIn the southwestern U.S., Dark-eyed Juncos live in a variety of wooded habitats that have openings with dense herbaceous ground cover, including parklands, and they avoid deep forest interiors (DeGraaf et al. 1991, Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  In Arizona they occur in unlogged Douglas fir and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities at approximately 2,700\u20132,800 m, but their densities in these communities approximately doubled 1 yr after the overstory was reduced by 50% (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  In southeastern Arizona, they can be found in riparian areas including areas dominated by velvet ash (fraxinus velutina), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), big-tooth maple (Acer grandintatum), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), Arizona walnut (Juglans major) and willow (Salix spp.) (Bock and Bock 1998).  In northern Arizona, they breed in Douglas-fir communities, Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998, Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  In Nevada, Dark-eyed Juncos breed in bristlecone pine at approximately 4,000 m (Pinus longaeva; Nolan, Jr. et al. 2002).  They may be an indicator species of habitat degradation in riparian aspen forests of the Toiyabe Mountain range in central Nevada (Warkentin and Reed 1999).  In the centennial mountains of Idaho, they occur in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willow communities (Douglas et al. 1992).  In Colorado, they use coniferous forests and mature aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests at approximately 3,000 m (Andrews and Righter 1992, Nolan, Jr. et al. 2002).  Studies of their densities in logged and unlogged aspen forests did not find differences in the two (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nWintering habitat of the Dark-eyed Junco is composed of a variety of open and semiopen communities including some woodlands, thickets, and weedy fields.  In the western U.S., they can be dense in grasses at the edges of coniferous forests, in open dry-belt forests, and in pines along the Pacific Coast, but they avoid mixed mesophytic and deciduous forests (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  In the southwestern U.S., wintering Juncos prefers weedy fields but also inhabit open woodlands, hedgerows, suburbs, streamside deciduous woods, thickets, pine forests, brushy roadsides, juniper-pine forests, semiarid scrub, chaparral, pinyon-juniper, lawns, fields, and farmyards (DeGraaf et al. 1991, Nolan, Jr. et al. 2002).   On Sonoran mountains, they move downslope after breeding to open woodlands of single-leaf pi\u00f1on (Pinus monophylla) and California juniper (Juniperus californicum) where they feed on grass seed (Bouteloua aristoides) in open areas (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  They also use chaparral in these areas (Repasky and Schulter 1994).  In Colorado, Dark-eyed Juncos winter in coniferous and riparian forests and thickets, shrublands, and wooded urban areas (Andrews and Righter 1992).  In southeastern Arizona, they winter in desert grassland and oak savanna (Bock and Bock 1998) and at almost all elevations in Utah with suitable food, but especially in lower valleys and foothills (Hayward et al. 1976).  In Gunnison County, Colorado Dark-eyed Juncos were found during the post-breeding season in areas of vegetation such as Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Wagner 1984).  Junco h. caniceps, which winters between western NE, western TX, Sonora, Chihuahua, northern Durango, central AZ, southern ID, southern WY,  southern NV, and eastern CA, uses pine or juniper-pine forests where annual precipitation <41 cm as well as dry-belt forests and semiarid scrub (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  They are densest on slopes and brushy ravines along the lower edges of coniferous forests (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nBetween the East Coast and the western edge of the Great Plains, densities of wintering Dark-eyed Juncos are highest in riparian areas, where annual precipitation >61 cm, and they avoid semiarid scrub and dry-belt pine forests (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  In North Carolina, they are rare in forests and grassy fields without weeds but common in those with crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) and tall weeds.  Junco h. carolinensis, which is found from northwestern WV and western Maryland to northern Georgia, leaves the mature-forests where it breeds to winter at lower elevations in power line right-of-ways, along roadsides, forest edges, and developed areas (Nolan Jr. et al, 2002).\r\n\r\nElevation limits for this species vary with region.  During the breeding season, it is found in the mountains of Idaho in the summer at elevations ranging from 1860-1940 m (Douglas et al. 1991), up to 3,506 m in Colorado and up to 3,049 m in other parts of the SW (Andrews and Righter 1992), at 4,000 m in Nevada, from 700 m to 2,040 m in Alleghenies (WV GAP), and 3,775 m in the Rockies, 750 m to 1,450 (tree line) in the southern Appalachians (although it is most abundant at 1,340 m), and at 120 -400 m near Corvallis, OR (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  During winter, it is commonly at altitudes =305 m in the western part of the country (Nolan Jr. et al. 2002).  N.
