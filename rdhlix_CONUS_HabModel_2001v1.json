Desert horned lizard uses sandy soil as burrowing sites located in flat, sparsely vegetated areas (Brennan and Holycross 2009). Also found in the arid regions of Nevada and eastern California; southwestern Idaho, and southeastern Oregon, western Utah. In Mexico, the species occurs in northern Baja California and northwestern region of the country. The species altitudinal range comprises low desert sinks below sea level up to 2000m in washes, alluvial fans, dune edges, flatlands, and volcanic outcrops. Saltbushes, sagebrushes, Greasewood, and Creosote Bush (Jones and Lovich 2009). Also associated with flora such as cactus and ocotillo. This lizard can be seen on hardpan or among rocks particularly where patches of sand are present.  Populations are reported to occur in proximity to dry lake beds, Lake County, and Harney Basin, Harney County; northwest Sonora, central plateau of Utah to eastern regions of Sierra Nevada and desert slope of southern California mountains (Stebbins 2003). It can be found in most desert basins below 1520m; northern Nevada, northeastern California (Honey Lake Basin and Surprise Valley), northeastern Utah, southeastern Oregon, and southwestern Idaho. It inhabits desert flats, brushy dunes, open hill sides occupied by Big Greasewood, Shadscale, Spiny Hopsage, and Big Sagebrush (St. John 2002).\r\n\r\nSonoran, Mohave, and Great Basin desertscrub, chaparral and Great Basin conifer woodland.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rDHLIx", "ELCode": "ARACF12060", "scientific_name": "Phrynosoma platyrhinos", "ITIS_TSN": "173943", "Global_SEQ_ID": "817747", "common_name": "Desert Horned Lizard"}}
