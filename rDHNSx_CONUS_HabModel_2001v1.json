Werler and Dixon (2000) and Dixon (1987) first reported on the exclusive distribution of this Heterodon species. Crother (2012) has included this species in its own species group. The area includes several habitats, but as with other hog-nosed snakes, the ability to burrow into loose soils restricts their distribution.\r\n\r\nSW-\tThis species is found around areas characterized by sandy loams and loose soils. Takes cover in the sparse vegetation of the eastern Texas\u2019 plains. The habitat can be described as sandy grassland, woodland, prairies and marshlands where this species can be found along water bodies and in the edges of grasslands (Natureserve.org).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rDHNSx", "ELCode": "", "scientific_name": "Heterodon gloydi", "ITIS_TSN": "", "Global_SEQ_ID": "", "common_name": "Dusty Hog-nosed Snake"}}
