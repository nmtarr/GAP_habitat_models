It occurs in oak-hickory hardwood forests and sandy, xeric conifer-dominated forest (Dodd et al. 2008), but forages in a range of forested communities, especially near cliffs and rocky bluffs (Dodd et al. 2008, Loeb et al. 2011).  Generally, Corynorhinus bats forage along vertical and horizontal structures, such as tree canopies, forest-open edges, riparian corridors, cliff and canyon walls, and low to the ground in open areas (Loeb et al. 2013). Cliffs and canyon walls are used as feeding roosts, where prey is dismantled and eaten (Loeb et al. 2013).  One measured foraging area was 71.5 ha, and these bats have been recorded foraging 10 km from their caves (Dodd et al. 2008).  N.
