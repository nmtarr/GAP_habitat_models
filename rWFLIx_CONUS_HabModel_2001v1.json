In the SWReGAP\r\nregion it occurs in the western quarter of Utah and all of Nevada except the\r\nsouthern tip ( Linsdale 1940; Rawley 1970; Stebbins 2003).\r\nOccupies a variety of environments (Stebbins 2003), including (1) disturbed\r\nareas, roadsides, gravel beds, or rock quarries; (2) rocky areas with boulders,\r\ncliffs, canyons, outcrops, talus slopes, or lava flows; (3) shrublands such as\r\nchaparral, sagebrush, creosote, saltbush, mixed oak-grasslands, or shrubsteppe;\r\n(4) riparian areas (such as with Populus fremontii, Fraxinus velutina, and\r\ntamarisk invaded), stream beds/banks, or cobble bars adjacent to rivers; and (5)\r\nconiferous woodlands (mostly pinyon-juniper) and open montane coniferous\r\nforests (Pinus jeffreyi, P. ponderosa, or Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Linsdale 1940;\r\nJohnson 1965; Clark 1973; Goldberg 1974; Tanner 1975; Jameson and Allison\r\n1976; Whitaker and Maser 1981; Cole 1983; Adolph 1990; Sinervo and Losos\r\n1991; Morrison et al. 1994; Grover 1996; Morrison and Hall 1999; Zani 2001;\r\nSabo and Power 2002).\r\n\r\nThis species is almost always found on exposed rocks if present and is largely\r\nrestricted to rocky environments, especially in Utah and Nevada ( Linsdale 1940;\r\nSmith 1946; Clark 1973). Will also use large trees in open forests and riparian\r\nareas but usually avoids open grasslands or dense shrubs unless boulders or\r\nfence present (Fitch 1940; Davis and Verbeek 1972; Grover 1996). Seems to\r\nprefer exposed sites but with shade and shelter nearby; burrows in soil or under\r\nlogs or rocks to nest, to escape heat in summer, and to hibernate in winter\r\n(Fitch 1940; Smith 1946; Gray and Stroud 1980; Sinervo and Losos 1991).\r\nOften found on fences, wood or rock piles, downed logs, tree stumps,\r\ntrunks/limbs of trees, or buildings because it uses its climbing skills to take\r\nadvantage of rough, inclined surfaces (Smith 1946; Davis and Verbeek 1972;\r\nSinervo and Losos 1991; Morrison and Hall 1999).\r\n\r\nRange-wide elevation limits are from sea level to 3300 m ( Bell and Price 1996;\r\nStebbins 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWFLIx", "ELCode": "ARACF14080", "scientific_name": "Sceloporus occidentalis", "ITIS_TSN": "173875", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106465", "common_name": "Western Fence Lizard"}}
