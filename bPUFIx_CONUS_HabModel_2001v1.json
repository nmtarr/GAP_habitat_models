They can also be found foraging in chaparral, grasslands, or wet meadows.  Terres (1980) reported that they nest in conifers in the eastern U.S. and in both deciduous and conifer trees in the western U.S.  Alderfer (2006) described regional differences in habitat associations with eastern and northeastern birds inhabiting open coniferous forests and mixed woodlands and western birds inhabiting montane coniferous forests and oak canyons.  Keller (1990) found that they do not breed in old growth continuous deciduous forests in New York and they breed at higher densities at forest edges and in areas with denser understories.  In California, this species occurs in a variety of coastal foothills and lowlands and is found in mid-elevation mountain ranges during the breeding season where it builds nests in conifers and near water sources.  Forest edges are important in these regions (CA WHR, downloaded 07/09/2003; NatureServe 2004).  \r\n\r\nWestern breeders at high elevations migrate to lower elevations in the late summer or fall while eastern populations migrate to lower latitudes (Wootton 1996, Alderfer 2006).  In the winter, Purple Finches use a variety of habitats including coniferous, deciduous, and mixed coniferous-deciduous forests, urban and suburban areas, mixed shrub and conifer habitats, weedy fields, and hedgerows (Wootton 1996).\r\n\r\nBISON (03/2002) reported an elevation range from 900 m to 2,130 m. \r\n\r\nN.
