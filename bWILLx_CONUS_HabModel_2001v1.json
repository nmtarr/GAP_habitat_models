The Western Willet breeds on interior wetlands of the Great Plains and Great Basin while the Eastern Willet breeds on beaches and marshes along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.  Most individuals of the Western Subspecies winter along the Pacific Coast but considerable numbers are observed on the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts as well.  The Eastern Subspecies winters along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, as well as the Caribbean.  Both subspecies sometimes winter in South America (Lowther et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nWestern Willets breed on wetlands and grasslands with short sparse cover, semiarid plains near water in eastern Oregon, grasslands adjacent to shallow wetlands, native grasslands and, occasionally, agricultural crops in North Dakota, uplands near brackish or saline wetlands, alkali flats in Utah, and lakes on forested mountains (Lowther et al. 2001).  In the northern Great Plains, nearly all breeding Willets and 70% of broods in one survey were found within wetlands or in adjacent grasslands.  Sagebrush habitats near ponds are used in the Great Basin and nests are also placed on native grasslands, seeded grasslands, and croplands in the North-central United States.  The preferred wetlands are ephemeral, temporary, seasonal, or alkali as opposed to semipermanent or permanent and are open and lightly vegetated (Lowther et al. 2001).  Willets forage in shallow water and shorelines of wetlands and in margins of ponds and lakes. \r\n\r\nEastern Willets breed in salt marshes, barrier island and beaches and are only rarely found in freshwater marshes (Lowther et al. 2001).  They build nests on the ground along salt marshes in cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora and S. patens) or in American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) on sand dunes and forage in oysterbeds, mudflats, sparsely vegetated salt marshes, sandy beaches, and along tidal creeks (Lowther et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nWintering habitats along the Pacific, Gulf, and Atlantic Coasts include intertidal mudflats, estuarine marshes, sandy beaches, and rocky coastlines.  \r\n\r\nN.
