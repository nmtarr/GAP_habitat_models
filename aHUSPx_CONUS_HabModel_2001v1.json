The Hurter\u2019s spadefoot can be found in sandy, gravelly, or soft, and light soils. Habitat can be sparsely to densely vegetated such as sandy open woodlands, savannah, or mesquite scrub (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\nFound in temporary pools along riparian corridors. Terrestrial habitats include herbaceous grassland, savanna, chaparral, shrubland, and hardwood to mixed woodlands.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aHUSPx", "ELCode": "AAABF01050", "scientific_name": "Scaphiopus hurterii", "ITIS_TSN": "206987", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103646", "common_name": "Hurter's Spadefoot"}}
