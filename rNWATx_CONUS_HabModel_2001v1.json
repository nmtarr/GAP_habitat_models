The range extends from Maine, southern Quebec, southern Ontario, southern Minnesota, to extreme southern South Dakota, eastern Colorado, extreme northern Texas, southern Louisiana, Florida, western South Carolina, and North Carolina (Conant and Collins 1991; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Gibbons and Dorcas 2004; Hammerson 1999; Stebbins 2003). The elevation of habitats ranges from sea level to approximately 1675 meters (Stebbins 2003). Burrowing takes place in or using soil, but could also occur in fallen logs, or leaf litter. Hibernation sites include burrows, or among rocks, or in deep crevices, usually near the water\u2019s edge (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nHabitats of preference include rivers, creeks, canals, oxbows, lakes, marshes, reservoirs, ponds, swamps, and bogs. Also found in river mouths, shallow water pools, springs, brooks, and low gradient streams. Riparian habitats include forested wetland, herbaceous wetland, and scrub-shrub wetland. This species is readily observed basking in sunny areas nearby piles of debris and wood deposited by floods at the margins of water bodies.
