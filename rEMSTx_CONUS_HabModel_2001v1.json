Populations in the U. S. are found in Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and west to central Texas. Populations appear in smaller, isolated settlements in south-central Kansas. In Mexico, populations have only been reported in Chihuahua (Buhlman and Gibbons 2001; Ernst and Barbour 1989). \r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and leaf litter. Its habitat includes creeks, medium sized rivers, low gradient streams, and shallow water pools and springs. It is commonly associated with riparian wetland areas throughout its range. More specifically, this species is commonly found near bodies of water characterized by soft bottoms and slow moving freshwater currents (Buhlman and Gibbons 2001, Natureserve.org). Hibernation takes place in bottom mud, debris, in holes in banks often in congregation. Eggs are laid in close proximity to the water (about 50 meters) under logs, rocks, stumps, leaf litter, and soil (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nCover is provided by dense vegetation found along permanent bodies of water.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEMSTx", "ELCode": "ARAAE02040", "scientific_name": "Sternotherus odoratus", "ITIS_TSN": "173758", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104790", "common_name": "Eastern Musk Turtle"}}
