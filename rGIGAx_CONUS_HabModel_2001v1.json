In the past, this species was found in most of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California, from Butte County to Kern County (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Rossman et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003). Current populations are found in ride production areas of Sacramento, Sutter, Colusa, Butte, and Glenn counties; along the eastern edges of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta from the Laguna Creek-Elk Grove portion of central Sacramento County; also along the western face of the Yolo Bypass in Yolo County; and south to Stockton, San Joaquin County (USFWS 1993). Several populations in this portion of its range have recently been lost primarily to habitat degradation (USFWS 1999).\r\n\r\nThe giant gartersnake burrows in or using soil, leaf litter, and decaying logs. In general, the habitat of this species includes creeks, medium sized rivers, and shallow water pools. Also in some riparian zones such as herbaceous wetland. This species is described as an aquatic snake that is commonly found in marshes, low gradient streams, sloughs, and lakes characterized by cattails, willows, bulrushes, and other similar water-emerging vegetation (California Department of Fish and Game 1990; Rossman et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003; USFWS 1993). Riparian woodlands do not represent suitable habitat due to excess shade and inadequate prey. This species is also absent from large rivers and other water bodies that contain populations of large, predatory, introduced fish species. Wetlands characterized by gravel, sand, or rock substrates also represent unsuitable habitat (USFWS 1993).\r\n\r\nSW\t-This species uses as cover the vegetation found in association to slough, marshes, and lakes. Basking areas and cover is provided by cattails, willows, and bulrushes.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rGIGAx", "ELCode": "ARADB36150", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis gigas", "ITIS_TSN": "209147", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106098", "common_name": "Giant Gartersnake"}}
