This species has been introduced in Florida, Guam, New York, California, and Hawaii (Ashton and Ashton 1991; Ehret and Parker 2005; Hutchison 1992; Klemens 1993; McCoid 1992; McKeown 1996; Stitt et al. 2004; Stuart 1995; Townsend et al. 2002). The habitats of preference include big rivers, creeks, low-gradient streams, medium-sized rivers, shallow water pools, and forested and herbaceous wetland (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nThe pond slider is commonly found in quiet waters with abundant aquatic vegetation and characterized by soft bottoms and plenty of basking sites. This species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and leaf detritus. Eggs are laid in soft damp soil in relatively open areas. The nesting site can be far or near water, while hibernation takes place underwater or in protected areas near the waterline (Ernst and Barbour 1972). In Costa Rica, some females have been reported to nest on Caribbean Sea beaches (Moll 1994).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rPOSLx", "ELCode": "ARAAD09010", "scientific_name": "Trachemys scripta", "ITIS_TSN": "173819", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104105", "common_name": "Pond Slider"}}
