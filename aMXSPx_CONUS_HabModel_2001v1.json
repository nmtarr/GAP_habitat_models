Urbanization and water development are main causes of extirpation from historical range (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nThis species is found in shortgrass plains, creosote bush and sagebrush deserts, desert grassland, mixed grassland and chaparral, pinon-juniper and pine-oak woodlands, but also open pine forest. Habitat is characterized also to have sandy or gravelly soils (Stebbins 2003). Found primarily in grassland, but in Arizona it can be found in Arizona Upland Desertscrub and into Petran Montane Conifer Forest (Brennan and Holycross 2009). In New Mexico, this species is found in sagebrush flats, river valleys, agricultural parcels, semiarid shrublands, and grasslands (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Found in alkali flats and playas while absent from extreme deserts (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding occurs in ephemeral pools and playas, stock tanks, pools at the base of roads and railroad grades, tanks in rocky streambeds, temporary streams and arroyos (Lannoo 2005). Newly emerged metamorphs and small juveniles may not be able to burrow being forced to take cover in cracks and mammal burrows (Ruibal et al. 1969).\r\n\r\nAssociated mainly with grassland species; sagebrush desert, creosote bush, shortgrass, but also found in pinon-juniper and pine-oak woodlands.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aMXSPx", "ELCode": "AAABF02040", "scientific_name": "Spea multiplicata", "ITIS_TSN": "206993", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104240", "common_name": "Mexican Spadefoot"}}
