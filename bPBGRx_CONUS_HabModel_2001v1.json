It breeds in emergent vegetation along lakes, ponds, reservoirs, marshes, sloughs, and slow-moving streams and river margins.  It prefers open, fresh water with some aquatic vegetation; avoiding water bodies with no emergent vegetation.  It will occasionally uses brackish water as well.  This Grebe is strictly aquatic, so terrestrial vegetation has little influence on its distribution.  It forages on aquatic vegetation and insects, fish, crustaceans, etc. by diving in open waters, along the shore among emergent plants, and under mats of floating vegetation (Hamel 1992, Muller and Storer 1999).  \r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, Pied-billed Grebes are fairly common during their non-breeding season and breed mostly in the Atlantic Coastal Plain and very erratically in the Piedmont and mountains.  \r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, Pied-billed Grebes prefer riparian areas, shorelines with dense aquatic vegetation, and overgrown, marshy wetlands, especially those containing cattails.  They are not typically found at high elevations and semidesert areas.  During migration and winter, they also use large reservoirs.  They can be seen year round in the Southwestern lowlands on freshwater ponds, marshes, lakes, salt bays in winter.  They are common statewide in Nevada, and are common spring and fall migrants and summer residents in the western valleys, mountain parks, and eastern plains of Colorado.  They are rare in Colorado\u2019s foothills and lower mountains during migration but winter in northern Utah and north-central Colorado on ice-free water bodies.  They are absent from deserts in northern and western Arizona.  They can be found year round in Utah but some individuals leave during the winter. \r\n\r\nMuller and Storer (1999) reported a minimum water body size of 0.2 ha for breeding and reported elevation limits of 1,250 m in British Columbia and 2,500 m in Baja California.
