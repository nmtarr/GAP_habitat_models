(1986), Collins and Taggart (2002), and Crother et al. (2000). According to the Environmental Report of the James White Parkway Taskforce (2002; http://web.utk.edu/~nolt/envrepts/JWP.htm), a viable population still exists in Berry Cave, in Roane County. At Mud Flats Cave in western Knox County, habitat has severely degraded recently by silt from the Gettysvue housing development, and recent efforts to find the salamander there have failed; that population may now be extirpated. Two specimens were once found in a ditch near Athens, but nobody knows how they got there or whether they represent some still extant population in that area. The only other place where the salamander has been found is the Meades Quarry/Cruze cave complex in south Knoxville (elevation around 270 m).\" Therefore, this Tennesse endemic is extant from only two locations - Berry Cave, Roane County, and an un-named cave near Meades Quarry in Knox County. A cave obligate species, G. gulolineatus prefers inflow (sinkhole) caves over outflow caves because the incoming detritus provides essential nutrients (Beachy 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBCSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD06040", "scientific_name": "Gyrinophilus gulolineatus", "ITIS_TSN": "550249", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104271", "common_name": "Berry Cave Salamander"}}
