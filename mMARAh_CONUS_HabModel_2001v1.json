Lower Keys marsh rabbits have been recorded at 50 of these 81 areas. The majority of these areas of suitable habitat are smaller than 3 ha and the total amount of habitat occupied by the Lower Keys marsh rabbit is about 253 ha (Forys et al. 1996). Lower Keys marsh rabbits have been found on only a few of the larger Lower Keys (specifically, Boca Chica, Saddlebunch, Sugarloaf, and Big Pine Keys) and the small islands near these Keys. There is a large gap in the distribution of Lower Keys marsh rabbits from Cudjoe Key to the Torch Keys.\r\nThe Lower Keys marsh rabbit is habitat specific, depending upon a transition zone of grasses and sedges for feeding, shelter, and nesting. This species primarily occurs in the grassy marshes and prairies of the Lower Keys; which are transitional areas similar in form and species composition to communities interspersed throughout mangrove forests of mainland Florida (Forys and Humphrey 1996). These wetland communities lie in the middle of the salinity gradient in the Lower Keys. Major vegetative species include grasses (Monanthochloe littoralis, Fimbristylis castaneasea); succulent herbs (Borrichia frutescens, Batis maritima, Salicornia virginica); sedges (Cyperus spp.); and sparse tree cover (Conocarpus erectus and Pithecellobium guadalupense). Lower Keys marsh rabbits also use marshes at the fresh water end of this salinity gradient. Fresh water marsh areas are dominated by sedges like sawgrass (Cladium jamiacense), with succulent herbs like seashore dropseed (Sporobolus virginicus) and grasses like cordgrass (Spartina spp.). Fresh water marshes are found in depressions in the interior of only a few islands, primarily in the Lower Keys. During the wet season these areas can accumulate standing water. Marsh rabbits also use coastal beach berm habitat, which is a relatively rare habitat consisting of a vegetated high ridge of storm-deposited sand and shell. Coastal berms are vegetated with over 84 plant species, including blolly (Guapira discolor), gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum), seagrape (Coccoloba uvifera), and Spanish stopper (Eugenia foetida) (Kruer 1992).\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMARAh", "ELCode": "AMAEB01031", "scientific_name": "Sylvilagus palustris heferni", "ITIS_TSN": "", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105702", "common_name": "Lower Keys Rabbit"}}
