Populations are small and widely scattered.  Slash pine flatwoods provide only a small fraction of the habitat occupied by adult flatwoods salamanders. The wetter portion of pine flatwoods and associated seepage bogs, especially near by swamps and cypress strands are preferred habitat. Breeding occurs in ephemeral habitats including pine flatwoods depressions, cypress- or blackgum-dominated swamps, ditches, borrow pits, and marshy pasture ponds. They are also occasionally seen in pitcher plant bogs. These breeding sites are typically associated with longleaf pine, slash pine, and wiregrass.  Eggs are laid terrestrially and hatch a few hours after inundated.  Most longleaf-wiregrass communities have been destroyed and replaced by slash pine or mixed slash pine-longleaf communities (Petranka).  Movements of greater than 1700 m have been recorded away from breeding ponds into surrounding flatwoods and adults regularly move 300 to 500 m from breeding ponds.  The adults are fossorial and spend the non-breeding season in crayfish burrows and root channels.  Prescribed winter burns may be harmful as the salamanders are near the surface in winter. Harmed by ditching & clear cuts (Ashton 1988). Home range may be about 1500 square m of lowland wet pine or temperate flooded pineland (Ashton 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRFSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01210", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma bishopi", "ITIS_TSN": "775866", "Global_SEQ_ID": "802300", "common_name": "Reticulated Flatwoods Salamander"}}
