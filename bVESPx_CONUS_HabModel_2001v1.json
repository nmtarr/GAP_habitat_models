Univ. of the State of New York, Albany."}, "habitat_description": "This species occupies a broad range of grassland habitat types, including native prairie, semidesert grasslands, montane and desert shrublands, sagebrush steppe, montane meadows, old fields, pastures, haylands, reclaimed surface mines, weedy fencelines, croplands, weedy roadsides, and woodland edges with scattered trees and shrubs. Probably requires song perches, such as fences, shrubs, crop residue, tall weeds, woodlands bordering fields (Best and Rodenhouse 1984). Elevation of breeding habitat ranges from sea level to 3,000 m (Ligon 1961).\r\n\r\nNortheast/Southeast:\r\nIn the East, suitable habitats include old fields, reclaimed surface mines, crop and haylands, weedy roadsides (Eaton 1914, 1988), natural meadows, and grasslands. In Maine, abundance positively correlated with increasing area; reached 50% incidence at 20 ha in grassland barrens (Vickery et al. 1994); especially uses areas with <43% blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) cover (Vickery et al. 1992a). Uses cornfields, hayfields, and reclaimed surface mines in Pennsylvania (Peterjohn 1989, Santner 1992) and surface mines in W. Virginia soon after reclamation (Wray et al. 1982). In N. Carolina, breeders often associated with high-elevation \u201cbalds\u201d; i.e., Appalachian summit meadows dominated by grasses and/or heath (quoted directly from Jones and Cornerly 2002).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\nIn the Midwest, inhabits edge habitats, such as fencerows between crop fields and edges between croplands and woodland (Berger 1968, Wiens 1969, Stewart 1975, Rodenhouse and Best 1983, Perritt and Best 1989). Breeds in croplands, pasture, and remnant native grasslands; no habitat characteristic was significantly related to nesting success, although number of washes and crop residue were important (Best and Rodenhouse 1984). In Missouri, breeds in short-grass fields and pastures with scattered trees and shrubs (Robbins and Easterla 1992) and short cover (Dechant et al. 2000). In Michigan, occurs in old fields, grasslands, croplands, pastures, shrubby uplands, orchards, residential roadside-hedgerow areas (Beaver 1991), and young (first growing season postfire) jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forests (Krueger 1981, Best and Rodenhouse 1984). In s. Wisconsin, not encountered in any wet habitat or in habitats with tall, dense vegetation (Sample and Mossman 1997). In Ohio, used open areas (mean 10 ha; range 5\u201315) replanted through Conservation Reserve Program (CRP; Swanson 1996); these lands generally planted with perennial nonnative grass vegetation in order to curtail soil erosion and improve soil and water quality in many areas of West and Midwest. In Iowa, species represented 87% of all nests found in row-crops; significantly more abundant in row-crops than in CRP fields (Patterson and Best 1996). Observed in thickets, small trees, and shrubs, wooded draws, fencerows containing trees or shrubs (Best 1983), weedy waterways (Bryan and Best 1994), and areas of coarse forbs or weeds (Stewart 1975, Arnold and Higgins 1986). In N. Dakota, populations slightly higher where shrubs (primarily Artemisia) present, and abundance positively associated with wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.), Junegrass (Koeleria cristata), fringed sagewort (Artemisia frigida), and big sagebrush (A. tridentata; Kantrud and Kologiski 1982); recorded in mixed-grass prairie only on transects with some shrubs, especially snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalus) and silverberry (Eleagnus commutata; Arnold and Higgins 1986) and common in fields of fallow croplands or sunflower (Helianthus spp.) and wheat-crop fields (Lokemoen and Beiser 1997). In n. Great Plains, found more in croplands than CRP planted to alfalfa (Medicago sativa), wheatgrass, or smooth brome (Bromus inermis; Johnson and Igl 1995). In tall-grass prairie fragments in Illinois, species encountered on small (<10 ha) sites but not on a single 650-ha site (Herkert 1994). In Wisconsin, highest densities in short-grass, mainly in row-crops, fallow fields, conifer, and oak (Quercus spp.), or river barrens (Sample and Mossman 1997)(quoted directly from Jones and Cornerly 2002).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn the West, native breeding habitat includes montane meadows, grasslands, prairie, and sagebrush steppe; species favors grasslands with some shrub component, particularly big sagebrush (Rotenberry and Wiens 1980a). In a study examining relationship between vegetation and bird density in montane grassland, shrubsteppe, and tall-grass, mixed-grass, and short-grass prairie in w. and central U.S., Vesper Sparrows occurred only in shrubsteppe and montane meadow habitats; most abundant in montane meadow in Montana, where abundance was positively correlated with forb cover and extent of variation in height of nearest forb or shrub (Rotenberry and Wiens 1980a). Breeds in e. Montana in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, early-seral stage woodlands, and croplands (Hutto 1995). In e. Montana, eradication of sagebrush with 2, 4-D, increasing grass cover and reducing forb abundance, had no significant change in density of breeding pairs (Best 1972). In sagebrush steppe, tolerates a wide range in canopy cover (Feist 1968). In Colorado, also uses pi\u00f1on (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) openings with small dense shrubs (Sedgwick 1987). Breeds in New Mexico from 2,100 to 3,000 m on grassy mesas and valleys (Ligon 1961). In Great Basin of Nevada and Utah, breeds in higher valleys and montane areas, especially shrubsteppe where shrubs are low and ground is sparsely covered with grass; pi\u00f1on-juniper habitats; and subalpine meadows (Ryser 1985). Considered a near obligate of sagebrush steppe in Wyoming, Nevada, and Idaho (Medin et al. 2000). Positively correlated with coverage of green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus) and bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) in nw. Great Basin (Wiens and Rotenberry 1981). In e. Oregon, found in a wide range of habitat types including grassland, shrubsteppe, juniper-steppe, montane meadows, fallow and cultivated fields, dry open woodlands, and forest openings; also associated with lightly grazed pastures with scattered shrubs and 2- to 5-yr-old Christmas tree farms with grass and weeds (B. Altman pers. comm.). Occurs in areas <4 ha, while breeding abundance greater at elevations >1,220 m (e. Oregon; B. Altman pers. comm.)(quoted directly from Jones and Cornerly 2002).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThis is a ground-dwelling species which prefers dry grass fields with some shrubs and is found in open habitats including old fields, shrubsteppe, grasslands and cultivated croplands (Jones and Cornely 2002). Is considered a moderate habitat generalist; breeds in dry, open habitats with short, sparse, and patchy herbaceous vegetation; some bare ground; and low to moderate shrub or tall forb cover (Jones and Cornely 2002). Occupies a broad range of grassland habitat types, including native prairie, semidesert grasslands, montane and desert shrublands, sagebrush steppe, montane meadows, old fields, pastures, haylands, reclaimed surface mines, weedy fencelines, croplands, weedy roadsides, and woodland edges with scattered trees and shrubs (American Ornithologists' Union 1983). Breeds in drier grasslands on upland or well-drained soils; in open or burnt-over forest clearings where there is sparse vegetation (Harrison 1978).  Appears in southern Arizona as migrants and winter residents only; were found to be more abundant on burned areas than unburned areas in southern Arizona (Gordon 2000). Can be found in northwestern Colorado in vegetation that is short and dense; will avoid areas where vegetation is tall and patchy.  Also found in riparian areas in southeastern Arizona, including areas dominated by velvet ash (fraxinus velutina), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), big-tooth maple (Acer grandintatum), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), Arizona walnut (Juglans major) and willow (Salix spp.) (Strong and Bock 1990). Occurs in Nevada along roadsides, in fields, and in surrounding sagebrush near agricultural areas (Alcorn 1988). A common breeding bird of sagebrush areas throughout Utah (Hayward et al. 1976). In Utah in spring, can be found in areas primarily composed of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and also in areas dominated by grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), crested wheatgrass (A. cristatum), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and sandberg bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) (Castrale 1983). Breeds from 0-3,000 m (Jones and Cornely 2002).\r\nWinter range: tree and shrub savanna and semiarid scrub and in areas with stunted and sparse vegetation; avoids desert shrublands dominated by creosote bush (Jones and Cornely 2002).  Inhabits plains, dry shrublands, savanna, weedy pastures, fields, sagebrush, arid scrub, and woodland clearings (American Ornithologists' Union 1983). Winters in southeastern Arizona in desert grassland and oak savanna (Bock and Bock 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bVESPx", "ELCode": "ABPBX95010", "scientific_name": "Pooecetes gramineus", "ITIS_TSN": "179366", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103115", "common_name": "Vesper Sparrow"}}
