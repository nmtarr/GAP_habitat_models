In general, this species requires forested areas with a high, dense canopy and open understory (NatureServe 2009), and is generally absent or found  in reduced numbers in isolated woodlots of less than 40 Ha (Anderson-AL). The acadian flycatcher can be found in moist decidious and riparian forests, forested shady ravines, floodplain forests (generally at least 400-500 feet in width), and river swamps, hammocks and cypress bays (NatureServe 2009). It will also utilizes pine plantations ranging from 35-50 years in age (Whitehead and Taylor 2002). In general, the acadian flycatcher appears to prefer coniferous forests in the southern portion of its range (e.g., cypress swamps), deciduous forests in the center of its range (e.g., beech-maple; oak-hickory), and coniferous forests in the northern portions of its range (Whitehead and Taylor 2002). \r\n\r\nIn the southeast, the acadian flycatcher is generally found in swampy woodlands, including bald cypress (Whitehead and Taylor 2002). It is most abundant in mature oak-gum-cypress and oak-pine stands throughout the southeast (Barry et al 1995). In Tennessee and North Carolina, this species is generally found in areas less than 1000 meters in elevation, and is associated with streamsides bordered with rhododendron (Whitehead and Taylor 2002).
