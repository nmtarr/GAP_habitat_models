Little or no vegetable matter is taken (Schukman and Wolf 1998). This species also takes nests from other birds, including barn swallows (Kozma and Mathews 1995). Prefers open country-deserts, sagebrush plains, dry barren foothills, canyons and cliffs around ranches. Will nest in cliff crevices, holes in banks, sheltered ledges, tree cavities, and scrubby pinyon-juniper woodlands (DeGraaf et al. 1991). Summer resident in mixed conifer community in the Sandia Mountains of New Mexico (Tatschl 1967). Can be found in association with prairie dog towns in New Mexico, Colorado and Utah, in habitats of juniper (Juniperus monosperma) and cholla (Opuntia imbricata).  Also can be found in association with prairie dog towns in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) (Clark et al. 1982). Can be found in recently burned areas in southeastern Arizona, possibly due to increased insect populations (Bock and Bock 1988).\r\nSagebrush plains or rocky hillsides sparsely vegetated with brush and a few scattered pi\u00f1on (Pinus edulis) trees in New Mexico, nests up to 2,280 m (Bailey 1928). In Colorado, common on the prairie and in low country throughout, nests up to 2,850 m (Bailey and Niedrach 1965)(quoted directly from Schukman and Wolf 1998).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nSummer:\r\nIn Washington, this species prefers rimrock habitats along streams and dry farms, sometimes in bunchgrass (Jewett et al. 1953). In Great Basin, open areas in valleys and foothills, and where mouths of canyons open onto desert, sparsely treed localities with low scattered shrubs and bare ground (Ryser 1985). In California, interior valleys with grasses, shrubs, and occasional scattered trees; agricultural lands; grassy coastal bluffs; and typical xerophytic desert scrub in arid southwest; breeds from 60 m below sea level to 1,350 m (rarely to 2,550 m; Small 1994)(quoted directly from Schukman and Wolf 1998).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nSummer:\r\nIn arid regions of the Great Plains, Say's phoebes prefer especially rocky habitats that provide nest sites and open areas near buildings (Johnsgard 1979). In sw. North Dakota, rough, severely eroded badlands and steep dissected slopes of buttes; also in vicinity of abandoned or little-used buildings (farmhouses, sheds, and country schools) throughout range (Stewart 1975)(quoted directly from Schukman and Wolf 1998).\r\n\r\nWinter:\r\nWinters in southeastern Arizona in desert grassland and oak savanna (Bock and Bock 1998). In California, widespread in open, lowland habitat, grassy bluffs, fields, scrub, and agricultural areas (Garrett and Dunn 1981); lower parts of canyons in Orange Co. (Sexton and Hunt 1979). In Texas, groves along streams and prairies, but seldom in heavily forested areas (Oberholser 1974); also invaded fields, riparian bare grounds, often near cattle corrals in s.-central Texas (Kutac and Caran 1994). In lower Colorado River valley, AZ, mainly agricultural and sparse riparian habitats (Rosenberg et al. 1991). In Mexico, arid to semiarid open country with scrub, fences, and scattered trees (Howell and Webb 1995 . Although rare in Colorado, found usually around open water of streams and sewage ponds (Andrews and Righter 1992)(quoted directly from Schukman and Wolf 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bSAPHx", "ELCode": "ABPAE35030", "scientific_name": "Sayornis saya", "ITIS_TSN": "178333", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100085", "common_name": "Say's Phoebe"}}
