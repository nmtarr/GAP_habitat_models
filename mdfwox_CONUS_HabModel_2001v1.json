In Oregon, this species occupies dense thickets and tangles of small trees, shrubs, vines, brambles, and forbs (Verts and Carraway 1998). Interestingly, its distribution almost completely overlaps that of poison oak (Rhus diversiloba) suggesting a possible symbiotic relationship (Carraway and Verts 1991). Western Oregon plant associations include big-leaf maple, Oregon white oak, Douglas-fir, red willow, blackberry, nettles, and rose species. Eastern habitat plant associations include juniper, curlyleaf mountain-mahogany, bitter-brush, ponderosa pine, Saskatoon serviceberry, willow, and Solomon's seal (Verts and Carraway 1998).\r\nIn California, the dusky-footed woodrat is common along both the Coast Ranges and interior including the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, mostly below 2150 m (7000 ft). The species is absent from cultivated lands and open grasslands of the Central Valley and can be abundant in chaparral habitats. N. fuscipes feeds mostly on woody plants such as live oak, maple, coffeberry, alder, and elderberry (Linsdale and Tevis 1951). It builds stick nests at the base of shrubs, trees, or rock outcroppings with moderate amount of canopy cover (Brylski et al. [CAWHR 2008] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mDFWOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF08080", "scientific_name": "Neotoma fuscipes", "ITIS_TSN": "180373", "Global_SEQ_ID": "768534", "common_name": "Dusky-footed Woodrat"}}
