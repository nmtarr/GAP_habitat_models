The habitat is mostly characterized by bare rock, talus, scree, desert, grassland, savanna, shrubland, chaparral, and conifer and hardwood woodland.\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil, fallen logs, and leaf litter. Prolonged periods of inactivity are spent under rocks, in crevices, or underground. In Idaho, researchers have found individuals under surface rocks in the spring, but not as many during the summer (Diller and Wallace 1986).\r\n\r\nThe habitats of preference include arid and semiarid plains, canyons, and hillsides. These areas are predominately rocky, dissected terrain composed of sandy and gravelly soils (Hammerson 1999; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nSW\t-The sparsely vegetated areas of this species\u2019 range provide cover in the form of rocks, crevices, loose (non-compacted soils), leaf litter, and fallen logs.\r\n\r\nFrom Crothers et al 2012 regarding H torquata (modeled by ReGAP efforts) and 3 modeled species \"The nominal species H. torquata is now restricted to Mexico, three described forms occur in the USA, and the undescribed form is endemic to the Cochise Filter Barrier area of southeastern Arizona and associated New Mexico\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rDENIx", "ELCode": "ARADB18020", "scientific_name": "Hypsiglena chlorophaea", "ITIS_TSN": "174233", "Global_SEQ_ID": "817007", "common_name": "Desert Nightsnake"}}
