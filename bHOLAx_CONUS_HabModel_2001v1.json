Historically they were prairie specialists, but they have adapted to barren and herbaceous  anthropogenic habitats such as cultivated fields, pastures, row crops stubble, freshly plowed fields, and airports where they forage for waste grain and weed seeds (however, evidence is needed that these types are not sink habitats; Stevenson and Anderson 1994, Nicholson 1997).  Natural habitats include areas of short grass with scattered patches of bare earth, such as beaches, dunes, lake flats, desert playas, areas with scattered low shrubs, shortgrass prairie, deserts, brushy flats, alpine habitats, barren portions of shrubsteppe, and, rarely, open areas in forest (AOU 1983, Stevenson and Anderson 1994, Beason 1995).  \r\n\r\nHorned Larks typically nest in shortgrass or barren areas early in the year when such conditions are available (Hurley and Franks 1976).  Their nests are small depressions on the ground, often placed next to an object such, as a clump of grass or pile or manure. They always forage by walking while picking items from the ground and from plants within their reach (Kaufman 1996).  Home range sizes are approximately 1.2 acres (Schoener 1968).\r\n\r\nIn Florida, they occur along the coast on beaches, sand dunes, roadsides, inland shores of lakes or ponds, plowed fields, pastures, and airports. \r\n\r\nBreeding habitat in southwestern Idaho includes, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), mixtures of big sagebrush and winterfat (Ceratoides lanata), and areas of salt-desert shrubs, including shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia), bud sagebrush (Artemisia spinescens), winterfat, greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus), and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens; Lomolino and Smith 2004).  Grasslands that have formed as a result of intense fires caused by cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion are also used, and these grasslands contain Russian thistle (Salsola kali) and various forbs along with cheatgrass (Smith et al. 1984).  In Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, Horned Larks can be found in juniper (Juniperus monosperma) habitats with O. imbricate,in shrublands dominated by sagebrush (Artemisia spp.), and in habitats of shortgrass prairie in association with prairie dog colonies (Bouteloua spp., Buchloe dactyloides, and Opuntia imbricate; Lomolino and Smith 2004).  In Utah in spring, they can be found in areas primarily composed of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and also in areas dominated by grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass (Agropyron spicatum), crested wheatgrass (A. cristatum), cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) and sandberg bluegrass (Poa sandbergii).  Horned Larks nest in open grasslands throughout Arizona and commonly winter in areas where they breed.  In the semidesert grasslands of southeastern Arizona, Horned Larks are abundant during summer and can be found in areas of common mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), lovegrasses (Eragrostis intermedia, E. lehmanniana), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), and threeawns (Aristida spp.), shrubs of baccharis (Baccharis pteronoides), and goldenweed (Haplopappus tenuisectus; Bock and Webb 1984).  They are a common resident throughout Nevada (Alcorn 1988), and they nest primarily in open desert habitats in the Lower Colorado River Valley (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In west Texas, horned larks occurred in the sparsest grassland habitats with almost no cover.  \r\n\r\nThe winter distribution of Horned Larks is similar to the summer distribution but most populations breeding at higher elevations withdraw in winter to lower elevations and the southern limits of the winter range generally coincide with southern limits of breeding range.  Individuals do sometimes occur within portions of the southern Atlantic coastal plains (Hamel 1992) and into southern Florida.\r\n\r\nHorned Larks are found at elevation up to 4,000 m (Beason 1995).
