Typical habitat is flat or gently sloping with grass, forb, low shrubbery, and deciduous trees such as maple, elm, oak, and cherry (Barash 1989).  In the West and North, they also inhabit spruce-birch-aspen forests at low elevations (Barash 1989).\r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, Woodchucks may be found at low elevations at forest and woodland edges and in open habitats such as fencerows, thickets or brushy woodland edges, especially along fields, roads or streams.  In heavily forested mountain areas woodchucks prefer rocky outcrops and openings (Brown 1997; Caire et al. 1989).  In the East, they generally occur north of the Fall Line but are moving southward.  Human developments have facilitated the woodchuck's spread.  They den in well-drained soil and often select sloping areas as den sites.  They may also burrow around or under old buildings, in roadway edges and utility rights-of-way.  They are rarely seen above ground and may hibernate in burrows in wooded areas.  Young are born in a den within an extensive burrow system.  The breeding period extends from early March to mid-April and gestation lasts 31-32 days. The young are born from April to mid-May.  A single litter of 2-6 (average 4) is produced each year.  Sexual maturity is reached in one year.  Stacy Smith, 17June05/N.
