Occurs in Sierra Blanca in Lincoln and Otero counties within Lincoln National Forest (Ramotnik 1997). This species is associated with spruce and Douglas fir at elevations from 2400-3570 meters (Degenhardt et al. 1996). At high elevations (3570 m), this species is found in tundra habitat in the Sierra Blanca Peak in the White Mountains (Moir and Smith 1970). Stebbins (2003) elevational range extends the species to 3600 meters and includes localities in Agua Chiquite, Wofford Lookout, southwest of Monjeau Lookout, north of Summit Spring, and southeast of Koprian Springs. This species occurs within mixed mesic habitat forest above 2400 meters, where individuals can be found under logs, moist litter, bark, rocks, small woody debris, and under rockslides. In habitats above timberline, the Sacramento Mountains salamander is associated with mats of mosses and lichens, and rocks (Moir and Smith 1970). Adults are also reported within coniferous logs in advanced stages of decay; salamanders are usually found in small cracks and chambers in proximity to the inner bark surface of less decayed logs, or under the bark (Johnston and Schad 1959). This species is more frequently associated with Rocky Mountain maple, less with sparse understory, and rarely associated with Gambel oak (Weigmann et al. 1980). However, in some collection sites, small oaks (Quercus sp.) were present among dominant conifer stands (Johnston and Schad 1959).\r\n\r\nThis species is associated with Douglas fir, white fir, Engelmann spruce, and southwestern white pine; Rocky mountain maple, oceanspray, and gooseberry (Degenhardt et al. 1996).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSMTSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD01040", "scientific_name": "Aneides hardii", "ITIS_TSN": "173702", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105472", "common_name": "Sacramento Mountains Salamander"}}
