Some authors have even stated that the species is restricted to such environments (Davis, 1973); however, others have ascribed golden-crowned sparrows to upland sites, specifically to: mosaics of chaparral and open grassland (Grinnell and Miller, 1944); mountain shrublands of Prunus spp. with Ceanothus, serviceberry, currant, etc. (Carlisle et al., 2004); Oregon white oak woodlands (Anderson, 1980); gardens and developed parks (Sumner, 1933; Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Roberts, 1957; Norment et al., 1998); shrubby understories of open-canopy oak woodlands (Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Zeiner et al., 1990); and brushpiles in open-canopy oak woodlands (Gorenzel et al., 1995).\r\n\r\nZ. atricapilla sometimes ventures into open grasslands or savanna in close proximity to the habitats listed above (Grinnell and Miller, 1944; Robertson, 1957; Davis, 1973).\r\n\r\nThe species has been documented at elevations ranging from sea level (Browning, 1973) to over 2150 m in Nevada (Austin, 1969).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bGCSPx", "ELCode": "ABPBXA4030", "scientific_name": "Zonotrichia atricapilla", "ITIS_TSN": "179461", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101900", "common_name": "Golden-crowned Sparrow"}}
