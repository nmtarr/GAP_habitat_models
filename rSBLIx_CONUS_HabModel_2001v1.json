Slevin\u2019s bunchgrass lizard is found at high elevations (2000m) basking in open sunny areas surrounded by grass patches. Also found in grasslands as low as 1400m in areas of Santa Cruz and Pima counties. Heavy grazing has been identified as the main reason for serious declines in several populations. Found from grasslands to Petran Subalpine Conifer Forest (Brennan and Holycross 2009). In New Mexico, this species is restricted to elevations between 1561 and 1611m. Elevation ranges from the Sonoita Plains (1300m) up to Barfoot Park, Chiricahua Mountains (2683m) in Arizona.\r\n\r\nClumps of grasses are the preferred habitat as these provide refuge and thermoregulation opportunities. Grassland occupied by S. slevini may include Sacaton, grammas, panic, and tobosa grasses, while in mountainous areas bromes and muhlys are important. The range of this species comprises the mountain islands and high elevation grasslands of southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Commonly found in the Santa Rita, Dragoon, Huachuca, and Chiricahua mountains and in the Empire, San Rafael, and Sulfur Spring valleys of Arizona (Jones and Lovich 2009).\r\n\r\nBunchgrass in open coniferous woods (Stebbins 2003).
