These aquatic salamanders may be found in a variety of swampy habitats including slow-moving blackwater streams and creeks, and tupelo-cypress or willow oak-blackgum swamps.   They have also been observed in rice fields, ditches and millponds.  They thrive in larger aquatic sites of cypress and tupelo.  They are not known to travel over land so movement is apparently restricted to waterway corridors.  Adults congregate in leaf beds in winter.  Oviposition probably occurs sometime from March-May in South Carolina (Meffe and Sheldon 1987).  Eggs probably are attached to the undersides of objects in water.  The hatchlings appear in fall.  Paedomorphic, sexually mature in about 5 years.  Juveniles burrow into bottom.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aDWWAx", "ELCode": "AAAAE01050", "scientific_name": "Necturus punctatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173625", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103777", "common_name": "Dwarf Waterdog"}}
