Its habitat associations are more general than those of other shorebirds species (Oring et al. 1997).  \r\n\r\nBreeding occurs up to 4,700 m in elevation (Oring et al. 1997).  Nests are usually within 100 m of water but sometimes up to 300 m from water are built in a variety of habitats with some herbaceous cover for fledglings such as sagebrush, grassland, forest, shorelines and other open and semi-open, herbaceous habitats adjacent to open water (Oring et al. 1997).\r\n\r\nSpotted Sandpipers forage on the ground in habitats ranging from shorelines, meadows, fields, and gardens with low vegetation to dense forests.  Foraging sites are usually within 200 m of water, such as sandy ponds, creeks, streams, or rivers (Oring et al. 1997).\r\n\r\nThe Spotted Sandpiper is a summer resident throughout the Rocky Mountains region, breeding, in all montane parks.  Associated with forest streams, pools, rivers, usually at lower elevations but extending locally to alpine timberline and utilizing a wide array of open terrains with water present.  It is a common breeder in marshy habitats in Utah and a summer resident and transient in Nevada.  The species likes peat soil (very alkaline to mildly acidic).\r\n\r\nSpotted Sandpipers winter inland and at coasts in the southern U.S. wherever water is present (Oring et al. 1997).  They are uncommon to fairly common spring and fall migrants in western valleys, mountains, mountain parks, and eastern plains of Colorado, and common transients and an uncommon winter residents in the Southwest on ponds, lakes, and rivers, especially the Colorado River. \r\n\r\nN.
