In general, this region includes riparian zones, desert, grassland, chaparral, shrubland, and various types of woodlands where this species can be found.\r\n\r\nThis species is described as a secretive fossorial snake that can be found under rocks, debris, decaying logs, standing snag, and hollow trees. The eggs are laid in an underground chamber, rocky fissure, or in hollow trees and decaying vegetation. The habitat where this species occurs is characterized by arid to semiarid areas with sandy and loamy soils, rocky and sandy desert, cedar-ocotillo communities, thornbrush, cedar savanna, mountain slopes, creek banks vegetated by mesquite, open grassy plains, and rock-strewn hillsides. This species is often found near water and sometimes even near residential areas (Tennant 1998; Werler and Dixon 2000. \r\n\r\nGP\t-Cedar-ocotillo associations, mesquite trees, cedar savanna, and grassed and bushes.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rTXTHx", "ELCode": "ARADD01010", "scientific_name": "Leptotyphlops dulcis", "ITIS_TSN": "174336", "Global_SEQ_ID": "795090", "common_name": "Texas Threadsnake"}}
