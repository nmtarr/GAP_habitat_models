These conditions are met in the floodplain and swamp forests of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains, and in some moist forests of the southern Appalachians. On the coastal plains, this warbler occurs in the shadiest parts of the forest, with dense upper canopy, lower canopy and shrubs, and little herbaceous cover. In the mountains, moist lower slopes of mountain ravines at elevations to 900 m are preferred, and a shrub layer of rhododendron is most common (Meanley 1971).  Individuals were found primarily in sawtimber and to a lesser extent in pole stands of second-growth cove forests in the Southern Appalachians (Hooper 1978). Although often reported to inhabit canebrakes in the literature, it is clearly not exclusively a cane species; structure of the habitat - both overstory and dense shrub understory canopies characteristic of successional forests - is apparently of primary importance, and a variety of shrubs will do (Graves 2001). \r\n\r\nM.Sanders 07jan10", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bSWWAx", "ELCode": "ABPBX09010", "scientific_name": "Limnothlypis swainsonii", "ITIS_TSN": "178848", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103514", "common_name": "Swainson's Warbler"}}
