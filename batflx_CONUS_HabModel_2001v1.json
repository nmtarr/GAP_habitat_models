Except for small populations in southern Arizona and a subspecies that occupies Baja California, this species is completely migratory with little winter range in the U.S. (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  It is a summer resident in southern and eastern Utah, common summer resident in New Mexico, and statewide summer resident in Nevada. \r\n\r\nAsh-throated Flycatchers utilize desert and semiarid scrub, pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands, open, pure Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands (in Idaho and Wyoming), mixed juniper-yucca, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, sagebrush, thorn scrub and riparian woodlands (NatureServe 2011).  They are common in \u201clow to mid-elevation semiarid oak woodland, usually dominated by evergreen oaks; e.g., coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), interior live oak (Q. wislizenii), canyon live oak (Q. chrysolepis), scrub oak (Q. berberidifolia), Nuttall\u2019s scrub oak (Q. dumosa), and shrub live oak (Q. turbinella; Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  Mixed evergreen oak-deciduous oak woodlands, such as blue oak (Quercus douglasii) are used as well.  Humid, dense montane or coastal forests are not used by Ash-throated Flycatchers, but they can occur locally at dry, interior woodlands in otherwise humid sections of the California coast (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).\r\n\r\nDesert scrub habitats for the Ash-throated Flycatcher are dominated by \u201ctree yuccas (e.g., Joshua tree [Yucca brevifolia], Mojave yucca [Y. schidigera]), agave (Agave spp.), columnar cactus (e.g., saguaro [Carnegiea gigantea], organ pipe cactus [Stenocereus thurberi], card\u00f3n [Pachycereus pringlei]), foothill palo verde (Cercidium microphyllum), mesquite (e.g., honey mesquite [Prosopis glandulosa], screwbean mesquite [P. pubescens]), acacia (e.g., catclaw [Acacia greggii]), and ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens)\u201d (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  Dry washes dominated by desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), catclaw, mesquite, desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), and ironwood (Olneya tesota) are used as well (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).\r\n\r\nIn southern and eastern Utah, they frequent dry desert washes and benches with shrubs and low trees, especially juniper woodlands (Behle et al. 1985).  They are common in pinyon-juniper woodlands of the Sandia Mountains in New Mexico and throughout all zones in Arizona except densely wooded areas (Monson and Phillips 1981).  In the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona, they can be found in oak-juniper woodlands, with dominant species being Juniperus deppeana, Pinus leiophylla, Quercus emoryi, Quercus arizonica, and Pinus cembroides (Balda 1969), and elsewhere in Arizona in oak woodlands consisting of Quercus emoryi, Quercus arizonica, Juniperus deppeana, Juniperus monosperma, Pinus leiophylla, and Pinus cembroides (Balda 1970).  In Colorado, this species breeds exclusively in pinyon-juniper woodlands and riparian woodlands (Kingery 1998).  They are common breeders in the lower Colorado River Valley of Arizona in honey mesquite, screwbean mesquite, desert wash, and sparse willow habitats (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  They can also be found in southern Nevada in mesquite dunes, dominated by Prosopis pubescens (Alcorn 1988).  In Oregon, they are found in dry oak woodlands (dominated by Oregon white oak; Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  They are reportedly absent from riparian habitats along the extreme lower Rio Grande valley in Texas but are found in adjacent, arid scrub (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  They forage in relatively dry, open woodland or scrublands.  \r\n\r\nAsh-throated Flycatchers are often associated with ecotones including the borders between dense woodland or forested areas along washes, streams, canyon bottoms, or denser habitat near desert scrub, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, or sagebrush (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).   Ecotones between oak woodlands and broadleaf riparian communities, juniper, pi\u00f1on-juniper, and other species of pine (e.g., foothill pine [Pinus sabiniana], ponderosa pine [P. ponderosa]) are used too (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  \r\n\r\nThis species does not need to drink water and is, therefore, capable of inhabiting very arid environments (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  However, the highest densities and smallest territories are associated with riparian areas dominated by willow (e.g., Goodding willow [Salix gooddingii]), cottonwood (e.g., Fremont cottonwood [Populus fremontii], black cottonwood [P. balsamifera]), sycamore (e.g., Arizona sycamore [Platanus wrightii]), salt cedar (Tamarix chinensis), hackberry (e.g., net-leaf hack-berry [Celtis reticulata]), ash (e.g., Arizona ash [Fraxinus velutina]), alder (e.g., Arizona alder [Alnus oblongifolia]), walnut (e.g., Arizona walnut [Juglans major]), Arizona cypress (Cupressus arizonica), juniper (e.g., one-seed juniper [Juniperus monosperma] and Utah juniper), or smaller species such as desert willow, honey and screwbean mesquite, catclaw, and shrub live oak (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  It is also common in low- to mid-elevation oak and pine-oak woodlands and desert woodlands dominated by palo verde.  Densities are lower in chaparral, sparse desert scrub, and pinyon-juniper habitat than in riparian and oak and mixed woodlands (Cardiff and Dittman 2002). \r\n\r\nNest sites and food resources are limiting factors for this species\u2019 distribution (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  They are cavity nesters that require naturally occurring cavities, nest boxes, or shrubs or trees with trunks thick enough to contain a cavity and woodpeckers or Cactus Wrens to excavate cavities in them (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  However, they are opportunistic in their nest site selection and will use almost any cavity of suitable size (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).\r\n\r\nBreeding generally occurs below about 2,500 m reports exist for up to 2,750 m where drier woodland or chaparral habitats extend higher than usual, and a breeding range of 950-2,300 m was reported for New Mexico (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  Pure pinyon-pine woodlands above pinyon-juniper zones are often unoccupied (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, they use habitats similar to those used during summer, but expand into suburbs, parks, open deciduous woodlands, windbreaks in agricultural areas, riparian areas in more barren areas of the desert and forest edge.  Humid and dense forested areas are avoided in both breeding and non-breeding season (Cardiff and Dittman 2002).  N.
