Although it inhabits some deciduous forest types, it generally prefers shrubby, coniferous habitats adjacent to open, grassy spaces.  It has benefited from anthropogenic habitats and appears more common and abundant in suburban and rural areas than in natural ones and feeds in open areas such as lawns, and fallow fields adjacent to hedgerows, shrubs, brush piles, and similar features (Middleton 1998).   \r\n\r\nBreeding habitats vary among the geographic regions of the U.S. (Middleton 1998).  In Florida, Chipping Sparrows frequent open pine flatwoods, pine-oak woodlands, and roadsides with scattered shrubs.  In Trans-Pecos Texas, they inhabit montane pine-oak woodlands and are absent from areas of Texas that are west and north of the Edwards Plateau (Middleton 1998).  They occur throughout most of New Mexico during summer, including the Sandia Mountains, but are absent in the extreme eastern portion of the state (Tatschl 1967, Middleton 1998).  They prefer wooded habitat and are found in pinyon-juniper habitat in northeastern New Mexico (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma).  In Arizona, they occur in; mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains, riparian woodland, brushy margins of agricultural fields, and citrus orchards in the western edge of the state and lower Colorado River valley  (Rosenberg et al. 1991);  yellow pine forest in the Hualpais mountains (Stevenson 1936); Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) in the northern part of the state (Rosenstock 1998); and oak-juniper woodland communities consisting of Juniperus deppeana, Pinus leiophylla, Quercus emoryi, Quercus arizonica, and Pinus cembroides in the Chiricahua Mountains (Franzreb and Ohmart 1978).  In Utah, they are a common summer resident throughout the state (Behle et al. 1985) and use habitats ranging from brushlands up through juniper forests to coniferous forests up to the timberline (Behle et al. 1985).  They also occur in open pinyon-juniper forests on arid mountain slopes (Middleton 1998).  Chipping Sparrows occur in the western half of Colorado (Middleton 1998).  They inhabit pinyon-juniper woodlands (Pinyon pine and Utah juniper) with big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), Utah serviceberry (Amelanchier utahensis), true mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), rubber rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus) and mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus) and other shrubs throughout much of the state (Laudenslayer and Balda 1976), but in northwestern Colorado, they selected more open habitat where small trees, species diversity, and ground cover were above average (Sedgwick 1987).  In Nevada, they are a summer resident in the woodland and montane forests of most of the mountain ranges within the state (Alcorn 1988).  They are absent from California\u2019s central valley, coastal slopes south of Los Angeles County, and lowland deserts (Middleton 1998).  They are found in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where they are associated with small shrub patches (Sedgwick 1987).\r\n\r\nReported altitudinal ranges for breeding are 1372-3354 m in New Mexico (Ligon 1961) and up to 3700 m in the southern Rockies (Byers et al. 1995).\r\n\r\nThe winter habitat associations of the Chipping Sparrow are similar to those during the breeding season, but they are more common in riparian than coniferous forests (Middleton 1998).  The northern limit of their range is difficult to determine because it varies over time depending upon the harshness of winter conditions, availability of suitable habitat, and temperature (Middleton 1998).  In southeastern Arizona, they inhabit desert grasslands, oak savannas, and riparian areas dominated by velvet ash (fraxinus velutina), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), big-tooth maple (Acer grandintatum), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), Arizona walnut (Juglans major) and willow (Salix spp.; Monson and Phillips 1981, Bock and Bock 1998).  In Nevada, they winter in riparian areas and are transient in desert scrub (Alcorn 1988).  N.
