In South America, groups roost in city plazas and parks (Ridgely and Tudor 1989).  In the west and historically in the east nests in tree cavities, abandoned woodpecker holes (including those in saguaro cacti), crevices in rocks, in east and midwest nests completely in manmade birdhouses (Nature Serve).\r\nBurned-over forest and logged areas with dead snags left standing are often used, including muskeg (bog) with abundant burned snags in Alberta (Finlay 1975), but the birds\u2019 apparent absence from many areas in n. Rockies, intermountain region, California, Pacific Northwest, and Mexican highlands may mean that the species has more specific habitat requirements in these areas that are unknown (quoted directly from Brown 1997).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nNests exclusively in human made birdhouses near human settlements.  Appear to avoid higher elevations of the Appalachians (Robinson 1990).  Forages over ag fields and pasture and open water. Suburban habitats (Hunter 1990).  Inhabits farmlands, parks, suburban yards and villages preferably near water. Feeds over row crops and pastures. Nests in colonies in large box houses (Anderson 1981).  With the conversion to nesting in birdhouse, martins are now found almost exclusively in cities, towns or around human settlement and seem not to cue in on general habitat features per se.  They appear, however to avoid the higher elevations. Prior to house usage martins historically inhabited forest edge and riparian areas containing dead snags (Brown 1997). Found throughout Georgia at moderate and lower elevations, purple martins may be seen in open fields and cut over areas, especially in places near water.  They commonly nest in purple martin houses placed around farms, ponds, or residences. Coastal roosts from e. Texas to w. Florida are situated underneath concrete bridges and causeways adjacent to Gulf water (Brown 1997).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nOccur in Upper Sonoran through Transition zones. Usually avoids deserts and grasslands. In Colorado Rockies, breeds in aspen forest along edges of beaver ponds (Andrews and Righter 1992). Breeds in loose colonies in old growth aspen forests near parks and generally near water. Sometimes seen in mixed aspen/ponderosa pine or aspen/Douglas-fir forests. In some areas, nests in dead trees near or standing in reservoirs. Depends on not too closed forests with plenty of large holes for nesters. Local in Rocky Mountains but avoid most other mountainous areas. Inhabits open and cut over woodlands, open grassy river valleys, meadows, around pools, shores of lakes, marsh edges, agricultural lands, saguaro desert parks and towns. Prefers habitats near open water. Nests in tree cavities, abandoned woodpecker holes, crevices in rocks. Rare during summer in mountains of northern and central Utah but is more common during migration in lowland valley (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). Current breeding habitat in Utah: aspen and coniferous forests near mountain lakes. Found in Capitan Mountains and the Rockies (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). Purple martins inhabit forests, evergreen woodlands at lower (2800 - 5500 ft), middle (5000 - 7500 ft), and higher (7000 - 13,000 ft) elevations in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Highest elevation in Colorado is probably 3,110 m (Levad pers comm 2005).\r\n\r\nWestern subspecies do not widely use birdhouses and instead inhabit montane forest or Pacific lowlands, restricted to areas with dead snags containing woodpecker holes; generally patchy and local in occurrence. Usually avoids deserts (except P. s. hesperia) and grasslands. In Colorado Rockies, breeds in aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest along edges of beaver ponds (Svoboda et al. 1980, Zerbi 1985). Burned-over forest and logged areas with dead snags left standing are often used, including muskeg (bog) with abundant burned snags in Alberta (Finlay 1975), but the birds\u2019 apparent absence from many areas in n. Rockies, intermountain region, California, Pacific Northwest, and Mexican highlands may mean that the species has more specific habitat requirements in these areas that are unknown. In Chiricahua Mtns., se. Arizona, nested in single dead snags surrounded by pine and aspen forest but not along forest edge (CRB). Absent from similar mountain ranges in se. Arizona\u2014e.g., Rincon Mtns. (Phillips et al. 1964)\u2014and has recently disappeared from Chiricahuas (Hill 1991), so species may have unknown habitat requirements also in sw. U.S. Travels widely and feeds over many kinds of habitat, including desert scrub where it does not nest (Phillips et al. 1964, CRB). Highest known nesting in U.S. is 2,770 m, in Chiricahua Mtns., AZ (Kimball 1921, Brandt 1951, Brown 1984) and 2,770 m at Cloudcroft, NM (Bailey 1928); most birds in North America occur at elevations of approximately 2,600 m (quoted directly from Brown 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bPUMAx", "ELCode": "ABPAU01010", "scientific_name": "Progne subis", "ITIS_TSN": "178464", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104037", "common_name": "Purple Martin"}}
