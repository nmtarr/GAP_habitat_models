The species has been hard hit by White-nosed Syndrome (USFWS 2013).\r\n\r\nNorthern Myotis are typically associated with forests >100 years old (NatureServe 2014), but they are not restricted to it; they have been found using intensively managed and second growth forests too (USFWS 2013).  They are also considered a forest interior species (NatureServe 2014), but studies of their sensitivity to forest patch size and fragmentation have yielded conflicting results (USFWS 2013).   They usually forage between 1 and 3 m off the ground below the canopy of mature forests (USFWS 2013, NatureServe 2014) but are known to occasionally forage over forest clearings and water, and along roads (USFWS 2013, NatureServe 2014).  They are not primarily associated with riparian areas but rather forested hillsides and ridges (USFWS 2013, NatureServe 2014).  Suitable forests that are too far from suitable hibernacula may not be occupied.   Suitable habitat was historically patchy within the species\u2019 range (USFWS 2013).\r\n\r\nNorthern Myotis hibernate in caves, mines, and tunnels during the winter, but also roosts in trees during the summer.  Summer night roosts differ between males and breeding females: males roost in caves, mines, and quarry tunnels sometimes with non-breeding females, while nursing females and young roost in tree cavities. Maternity roosts are located in large, tall trees in locations that tend to be warmer than randomly located trees (USFWS 2013). Young of the year and post-lactating females may join males and non-breeding females in caves later in the summer (NatureServe 2014).  Day roosts are in hollow trees, under loose bark, in attics and barns, under the eaves of houses, behind window shutters, in bat houses, and in caves (SC-GAP 2003).  A variety of tree species are used for roosts; it appears that the inhabitable structures of a tree rather than the species are important (USFWS 2013).  They move to new summer roosts often; recorded maximum successive days spent at a roost vary between 3 and 11 days (USFWS 2013).  Canopy covers recorded at roost sites have varied but usually been above 50% (USFWS 2013). \r\n\r\nRadiotagged Northern Myotis in New Hampshire traveled an average of 620m between roosts and foraging areas (USFWS 2013).  Female home range sizes are between 19 and 172 ha (USFWS 2013).  N.
