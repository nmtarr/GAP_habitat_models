Populations can be found east of the Appalachian Mountains, east of the Apalachicola River in Florida, and also east of the Chattahoochee River in Georgia. Records for this species regarding its western distribution within its range are limited (Burbrink 2001). This species is presumably a ratsnake that has been introduced to the Bahamas, but precise identification of such species remains uncertain (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nThis is a snake that burrows in or using soil, leaf litter, tree logs, hollow trees, and standing snag. This species is known to burrow or to use deep crevices during hibernation. This species inhabits conifer woodland, savanna, hardwood forest, bare rock, cliffs, cropland, hedgerow, and various suburban settings. Its preferred habitats are characterized by wooded canyons, rocky timbered upland, wooded areas of streams and rivers, old fields, swamps, barnyards, and rural/suburban buildings. Reports include observations in areas comprised of open areas adjacent to wooded areas.\r\n\r\nNE\t-Woodland, savanna, hardwood forest, bare rock, cliffs, cropland, hedgerow, and various suburban settings.\r\n\r\nSE\t-Wooded canyons, rocky timbered upland, wooded areas of streams and rivers, old fields, swamps, barnyards, and rural/suburban buildings.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEARAx", "ELCode": "ARADB13080", "scientific_name": "Pantherophis alleghaniensis", "ITIS_TSN": "683033", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103363", "common_name": "Eastern Ratsnake"}}
