Rose, northeast of Lake Tahoe, in Washoe County, Nevada (Vredenburg et al. 2007). The southern part of the range in the crest of the Sierra Nevada is bordered by ridges dividing the Middle and South Fork of the Kings River, from Mather Pass to the Monarch Divide; into east of the Sierra Nevada crest, R. sierrae has been recently reported to occur in the Glass Mountains just south of Mono Lake in Mono County and along the east slope of the Sierra Nevada south to Matlock Lake in Inyo County (Vredenburg et al. 2007). \r\nThis species is currently reported as extirpated from Nevada and from most localities of the historical range in the Sierra Nevada of California (IUCN 2008).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSYLFx", "ELCode": "AAABH01340", "scientific_name": "Rana sierrae", "ITIS_TSN": "775211", "Global_SEQ_ID": "802511", "common_name": "Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frog"}}
