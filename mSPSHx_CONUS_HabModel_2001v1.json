They are perhaps most abundant in moist habitats with a dense ground cover of grasses, sedges, rushes, low-growing brush, and tangles of vines such as wooded swamps, marshes, and floodplain forest  (Jones and Birney 1998, Choate et al. 1994).  They are also found in upland habitats such as old fields, loblolly pine plantations, xeric hammock, sandpine scrub, pine flatwoods, and sandhills (Layne et al. 1977, French 1980).  Southeastern shrews are fossorial mammals that spend much of their time in underground burrows and in leaf litter.  Its range rarely overlaps that of S. cinereus.  Once considered rare, S. longirostris is generally uncommon, but is abundant in localized areas.  The young are born from April through October.  The litter size is 1-6 (average around 4) with 1-3 litters per year. Gestation probably lasts 2 - 3 weeks (if same as other shrews). Little is known about this species' life cycle.
