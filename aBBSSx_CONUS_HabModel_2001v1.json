This species also occurs in the Tehachapi Mountains at the southern and eastern margins of the Central Valley. Other isolated localities are found in southern Los Angeles, Orange, and extreme southwest Riverside counties. They are also widely distributed in Santa Cruz County. Overall, populations occur from near sea level to approximately 2260 meters on Mt. Pinos (Wake and Jockusch 2000). Egg deposition sites are understudied, but have been observed within logs in seepages on Mt.Pinos (2260m; Wake and Jockusch 2000; Green et al. 2013). Stebbins (2003) extends the elevation of some localities to up to 2500 meters. \r\nHabitat of preference for this species includes semi-arid blue oak savannas at the northern limits of the range, to the moist, oak-filled canyons and pine fir forests found at higher elevations. Comanche Point on the northern slopes of the Tehachapi Mountains represents an area occupied by this species characterized by semi-arid, grassy slopes, with scattered blue oak mixed with granitic outcrops. For example, at Mt. Pinos, salamanders are abundant in Jeffrey pine and white fir associations, especially near small streams and seepages. Other habitats in the Tehachapi Mountains include canyons with vast growth of canyon live oak and black oaks (Block and Morrison 1998; Lannoo 2005). In the range within southern California, occupied habitat consists mostly of foothills and mountainous canyons, generally within chaparral or coast live oak woodland. It is important to note that individuals have also been found in north-facing rocky slopes covered with coastal vegetation and California buckeye in the southern edge of Orange County (Cunningham 1960; Schoenherr 1976).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBBSSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD02050", "scientific_name": "Batrachoseps nigriventris", "ITIS_TSN": "173708", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104368", "common_name": "Black-bellied Slender Salamander"}}
