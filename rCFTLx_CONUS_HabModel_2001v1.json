In 1980, USFWS reported an estimated area occupied by this lizard to be about 839 square kilometers. A more current approximation of the range extent for this species is much needed.\r\n\r\nIts habitat consists of loose, fine sands that are suitable for burrowing. It is also known to occupy abandoned rodent burrows. The vegetation situations it is associated with include sandy dunes with patches of creosote bush and other scrubby plants (Stebbins 2003). More specifically, it has been reported that shelter is obtained through perennial native plants and the annual plant commonly known as bugseed (Dicoria canascens), which is vital in providing plant and insect foods, as well as shelter (Durtsche 1995 (As referenced by Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nFound in xeric areas characterized by creosote bush, but shelter and food is also provided by perennial plants and the annual plant Dicoria canescens.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rCFTLx", "ELCode": "ARACF15010", "scientific_name": "Uma inornata", "ITIS_TSN": "173948", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103488", "common_name": "Coachella Fringe-toed Lizard"}}
