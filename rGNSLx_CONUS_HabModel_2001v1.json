Also south to La Paz in Baja California, Mexico. Populations are also well established in various islands in the Gulf of California (Grismer 2002; Stebbins 2003). The elevational range extends from localities near sea level to approximately 2130 meters (Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nThe riparian habitats include bare rock, talus, scree, chaparral, shrubland, and various woodland types. This species is known to burrow in or using soil, but also vegetative litter. Similarly, eggs might be laid in soil (Natureserve.org). In more detail, the habitats of preference include granite outcrops in oak vegetated slopes and chaparral primarily on the coastal side of the mountain ranges of southern California. To a lesser extent, also occupies yellow pine habitat. On drier areas, this species can be found in rocky canyons, on rocks of alluvial slopes usually dominated by palms, agaves, willows, and mesquite. In Baja California, habitats are characterized by pinyon/juniper woodland and subtropical thornforest (Grismer 2002; Natureserve.org; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nFound in areas characterized by agaves, mesquite trees, willows, and palms. In its southern range, pinyon-juniper woodland and subtropical thornforest are strongly tied to the habitats occupied by this species.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rGNSLx", "ELCode": "ARACF14100", "scientific_name": "Sceloporus orcutti", "ITIS_TSN": "173877", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104024", "common_name": "Granite Spiny Lizard"}}
