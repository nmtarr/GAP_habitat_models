May also breed in mixed woodland when strong coniferous component is associated with deciduous trees such as aspen, oak (Quercus spp.), and poplar (Populus spp., and rarely in pure aspen woodlands that are up to 160 km from nearest conifer forests; Flack 1976). Western populations, particularly in Sierra Nevada of California, appear to be coniferous forest specialists, preferring high canopies and large trees; avoid burned areas (Raphael and White 1984). Eastern populations appear to be more tolerant of mixed-forest habitats, frequently occurring over wide range of forest types from pure coniferous to mixed stands that have significant deciduous component (e.g., Rail 1996).\r\nBreeding habitat ranges from sea level to high-elevation montane forests; in southern parts of range, breeding habitat is restricted to higher elevations (e.g., in N. Carolina, breeds in boreal forests above 1,000 m; in Tennessee above 1,600 m; in California, in mountains typically above 800 m; and on Guadalupe I., near 1,200 m)(quoted directly from Ghalambor and Martin 1999).\r\nWinter:\r\nSame as breeding range for most populations. Away from breeding areas, wide range of different habitats, but prefers conifers when available (Harrap and Quinn 1996). Wintering habitat includes deciduous forest, orchards, scrub, riparian woodlands, plantations, parks, shade trees, and gardens in suburban areas (Harrap and Quinn 1996). The irruptive nature and wide range of habitats used make identifying a preferred winter habitat difficult. However, consistently concentrated populations occur in dense forests of the Northeast, along Michigan-Wisconsin border south of Lake Superior, and in ne. Washington and se. British Columbia (Root 1988). In pine-oak forests of sw. Virginia, avoids clear-cuts up to 3 yr old during winter (Connor et al. 1979)(quoted directly from Ghalambor and Martin 1999).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThis species has a preference for forests that have a strong fir and spruce component; less common in pure pine and hemlock (Johnsgard 1992, Ghalambor and Martin 1999). Typically mature and diverse stands of coniferous forests, especially where spruce, fir, pine, hemlock, larch, and cedar are present (Johnsgard 1992). Prefers high canopies and large trees (Johnsgard 1992). Avoids burned areas (Johnsgard 1992). Coniferous and mixed forest, aspen woodland, deciduous forest, open woodland, parks, scrub, riparian woodland (NatureServe 2004). May also breed in mixed woodland when strong coniferous component is associated with deciduous trees such as aspen, oak, and poplar species' (Ghalambor and Martin 1999). In Colorado, primarily found in coniferous forests, less often in aspen and riparian forests; breeds most commonly in high mountain forests, especially spruce-fir but also lodgepole pine and douglas-fir forests; also occurs in gambel oak shrublands and lower coniferous forests in fall and winter (Andrews and Righter 1992). Species was noted in white fir, limber pine, and heavy pinyon-juniper in Nevada (Alcorn 1988). Resident of coniferous forests in mountains throughout Utah; during winter it tends to descend to lower elevations (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). Common in the Boreal Zone forests of northern Arizona, where it prefers spruce and fir (Phillips et al. 1964). The southern end of the species' breeding range in Arizona is reached in the southeastern border ranges which have firs, except the Rincon Mountains (Phillips et al. 1964). Predominantly occupy conifer forests in Colorado, occasionally inhabit deciduous forest-evergreen and quaking aspen association (Kingery 1998). Occurs between 1,067 and 3,506 m in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992). Found at 1,220-3,350 m in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).\r\nIn California, the Red-breasted nuthatch is a fairly common resident in conifer forests from low to high elevations throughout the state. Also a summer resident in the Sierra Nevada, Cascades, Trinity Mts., and other ranges in ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, red fir, lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, eastside pine, and coastal conifer habitats. Irregularly disperses to lowlands in winter where it sometimes forages on deciduous trees. An irregular visitor to the Channel Islands in winter. A highly irregular fall transient in desert regions, varying from common to absent. A sporadic fall transient and winter visitant to interior, Great Basin, and coastal California (Grinnell and Miller 1944,\r\nMcCaskie et al. 1988, Garrett and Dunn 1981)(quoted directly from Green et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nRed breasted nuthatches are permanent resident of the spruce-fir and hemlock forests of the mountains (Potter et al 1980). They prefer coniferous forest, although Kaufman (1996) lists mixed forests will also be used. Mature forests are selected for (Potter et al 1980, Simpson 1992) probably because old decaying wood present in these forests provides good nesting sites (Kaufman 1996). Limited to habitat above 3500ft. Nest is usually excavated by the breeding pair (Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996,  Potter et al 1980), but will also use natural cavities or old woodpecker holes (Pravosudov and Grubb 1993). Ordinarily the cavity is hollowed out in rotten snag or stub of a living or dead tree generally 5 to 40 above the ground (Kaufman 1996). Pitch is plastered around the opening of the cavity as long as the nest is active, and is thought to be a deterrent to insects and predators entering the nest (Kaufman 1996, Potter et al 1980). In central Ohio, using minimum convex polygons, males had an average home range of 2.7 ha (n=7), and females had an average home range of 3.37 ha (n=3). There was substantial home range overlap between individuals (Matthysen et. Al. 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bRBNUx", "ELCode": "ABPAZ01010", "scientific_name": "Sitta canadensis", "ITIS_TSN": "178784", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106131", "common_name": "Red-breasted Nuthatch"}}
