Hamel (1992) states they 'prefer upland often hilly woods, as opposed to bottomlands.'  Broad-winged hawks forage often from perches located along woodland edges or near water (Kaufman 1996).  They use broadleaf and mixed forest, preferring denser situations, and are less frequently in open woodland, including forest alpine meadows (Goodrich et al. 1996, NatureServe 2009).  They generally perch under or in the tree canopy, forage in forest openings, edges, and wet areas (Palmer 1988).  They will sometimes use utility poles for hunting perches (Stevenson and Anderson 1994), and may use pine stands (Imhoff 1976).\r\n\r\nAs summarized by Palmer (1988), nests are generally located 25 to 40 ft. above the ground, 'primarily in the first main crotch of a moderate- to large-sized tree and in the bottom 1/3 of the forest canopy.'  Several studies of breeding Broad-winged Hawks have reported average distances from nests to canopy openings and water.  These means range from 52 m to 143 m (distance to wet area) and from 42 m to 140 m (distance to opening)(Goodrich et al. 1996).  Titus and Mosher (1981) found that broad-winged hawks nested within 211 m of water and 292 m from forest openings.\r\n\r\nBroad-winged Hawks migrate along ridges, river valleys, and shorelines. Their winter range largely contained within the humid tropics.  Forests of this region include seasonably humid mixed and deciduous forests, and a variety of rainforest habitats. In the Florida Keys, they use undisturbed West Indian hardwood hammocks on the larger keys and extensive groves of mangoes and avocados in agricultural areas (Goodrich et al. 1996).  They forage on forest edges and natural short grass glades (Goodrich et al. 1996).  In winter, they may perch and feed along heavily traveled highways (NatureServe 2009).  N.
