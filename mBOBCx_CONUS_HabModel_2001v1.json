There are a number of criteria that can more accurately model bobcat habitat including canopy closure, landforms, edge, and patch size, distance between habitat types, etc\u2026.  For instance, cliff and steep slope landforms in proximity to large tracts of riparian/swamp/wetland forest, as well as ag lands.  There should be some minimum on canopy cover in forested map units since these provide cover for the species during resting periods.  However, strict canopy cover limitations should not be imposed on certain map units that may provide habitat for prey such as lagomorphs.  Include auxiliary MUs within 120m from cont. patches of primary map units. Kacy Cook ****Chamberlain et al. (2003) identified mean core size for breeding males in MS as 308ha and home range as 1769ha.  Males had larger home range & core use than females.  So changed minimum patch size from 1000ha to 300ha.

There are a number of criteria that can more accurately model bobcat habitat including canopy closure, landforms, edge, and patch size, distance between habitat types, etc\u2026.  For instance, cliff and steep slope landforms in proximity to large tracts of riparian/swamp/wetland forest, as well as ag lands.  There should be some minimum on canopy cover in forested map units since these provide cover for the species during resting periods.  However, strict canopy cover limitations should not be imposed on certain map units that may provide habitat for prey such as lagomorphs.  Include auxiliary MUs within 120m from cont. patches of primary map units. Kacy Cook ****Chamberlain et al. (2003) identified mean core size for breeding males in MS as 308ha and home range as 1769ha.  Males had larger home range & core use than females.  So changed minimum patch size from 1000ha to 300ha.

For instance, cliff and steep slope landforms in proximity to large tracts of riparian/swamp/wetland forest, as well as ag lands.  There should be some minimum on canopy cover in forested map units since these provide cover for the species during resting periods.  However, strict canopy cover limitations should not be imposed on certain map units that may provide habitat for prey such as lagomorphs.  Include auxiliary MUs within 120m from cont. patches of primary map units. Kacy Cook ****Chamberlain et al.

In Colorado, bobcats are most common in rocky, broken terrain of foothills and canyon lands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, BISON-M 2002). Preferred habitats are pinyon-juniper woodlands and montane forests, although they occupy all ecosystems in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, BISON-M 2002). Bobcats are found throughout New Mexico in almost all habitats, are probably rare on eastern plains and at higher altitudes in northern mountains (BISON-M 2002). Are perhaps most common in rocky country from desert through the ponderosa forest (BISON-M 2002). Various habitats including deciduous coniferous woodlands and forest edge, hardwood forests, swamps, forested river bottomlands, brushlands, deserts, mountains and other areas with thick undergrowth (NatureServe 2001). Large tracts of habitats are most favorable (NatureServe 2001). Favor sites with at least 52% vertical cover (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In Colorado, bobcats chose diurnal loafing sites in steep-sloped rocky areas with dense vertical cover (over 70%) (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In general, they prefer broken country with cliffs and rock outcrops interspersed with open grasslands, woods, or desert (Kolowski and Woolf 2002). Males selected lowland conifer areas and avoided upland conifer stands, upland deciduous forests and mixed savanna areas (Lovallo and Anderson 1996). Females exhibited similar patterns of use but also selected lowland deciduous forest and avoided unforested areas (Lovallo and Anderson 1996). In home ranges largely with contiguous forest, use of water features may be related to prey and cover (i.e., cane stands, edges of larger streams), but may be used simply for traveling between habitat types (Kolowski and Woolf 2002). Bobcats occur throughout most of the area, being most common in brush and forest edge situtations or in rocky canyons (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992). They even occur in city suburbs, though this is not very good habitat (NatureServe 2001, Riley et al. 2003). Snow cover in excess of 15 cm restricts their movements (BISON-M 2002). The elevational range is 107-3,150m (Hoffmeister 1986). Home range in Colorado is 40.5 ha (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Patch size in southern California is as small as 40 ha (Riley et al. 2003). In California, optimal habitats are brushy stages of low and mid-elevation conifer, oak, riparian, and pinyon-juniper forests, and all stages of chaparral. Suitable habitats for bobcats consist of large areas of broken, rough, rocky terrain supporting brushy deciduous and conifer forests or chaparral, adjacent to smaller areas of riparian habitat and stands of dense forest. Availability of water may limit bobcat distribution in xeric regions (quoted directly from Ahlborn [CA WHR 2008] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nThe bobcat uses a wide variety of natural habitats, especially mixed woodland habitats, and it is also able to change its way of life as civilization modifies the environment. Often found adjacent to agricultural areas as long as rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present. Resting and activity areas most often center around rocky ledges and conifer swamps in the north, bogs and swamps or brier or palmetto thickets in the south (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). The bobcat generally avoids mature closed-canopy stands of pine and agricultural areas lacking brushy cover. Home ranges and movement patterns are altered to avoid paved roads (Lovallo and Anderson\r\n1996).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest/Great Plains:\r\nIn Minnesota and Wisconsin, the bobcat prefers coniferous forests and swamps and avoids lowland deciduous cover (Berg 1979, Lovallo and Anderson 1996, Rollings 1945, Fuller et al. 1985). In Montana, preferred habitat includes dense conifer thickets, river bottoms, and black-tailed prairie dog towns (Knowles 1985). In Oklahoma, grassy and brushy areas are preferred while mature pines and oaks are avoided (Rolley and Warde 1985). In Iowa, bobcat presence and abundance were correlated with perennial grassland cover in association with woodlands (Linde et al. 2012). Woolf et al. (2002) found that patchy forested landscapes were predictive of bobcat presence in Illinois. In Texas, the bobcat inhabits \"broken country\"  and heavily wooded uplands and bottomlands including second growth forests. In the Edwards Plateau the species prefers rocky limestone habitats and rocky canyons, gulches, and cliffs within the Trans-Pecos region (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBOBCx", "ELCode": "AMAJH03020", "scientific_name": "Lynx rufus", "ITIS_TSN": "180582", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106470", "common_name": "Bobcat"}}
