In New Mexico, habitat is found in many places from creosotebush desert to open montane woodland where sandy or gravelly soils suitable for burrowing are available. Typical habitat includes sandhills, plains grassland, sandy floodplains, often, in the vicinity of, or along the margins, of the streams, irrigation ditches and ponds.
