It can be found in open, deciduous and riparian woodlands throughout its range and does well in early successional forests and along edges (Jackson and Oullet 2002).  Coniferous forests are also used but densities are lower within them than in deciduous forests, except when a deciduous understory exists (Jackson and Ouellet 2002).  Orchards and wooded, human-modified habitats, such as urban and suburban parks, woodlots, and residential areas, may be used as well (Jackson and Ouellet 2002).  Pine plantations in Virginia were used by the species, albeit uncommon (Jackson and Ouellet 2002).  Deciduous woodlands with small trees and low canopies have the highest densities of Downy Woodpeckers.  \r\n\r\nDowny Woodpeckers forage on live and dead tree trunks as well as on small branches and twigs, and they often visit suet feeders (Kaufman 1996).  They also forage in tall weeds and fencerows within suburban yards and parks and open woods (Jackson and Ouellet 2002).\r\n\r\nDowny Woodpeckers nest in cavities that they excavate from 3 to 50 feet above the ground in a snag or in the dead branch of a live tree (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Bent 1992).  It is generally excavated in wood softened by a fungus (Nicholson 1997, Jackson and Ouellet 2002).  They do not nest in bird houses, although they will roost in them, but nests in fence posts have been documented (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Jackson and Ouellet 2002).\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, Downy Woodpeckers occur throughout all forested mountains in New Mexico, including the Sandia Mountains (Ligon 1961, Tatschl 1967).  Their occurrence is limited in the northern, western and eastern parts of Nevada, but transient individuals are sometimes found in southern Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  Southwestern Downy Woodpeckers prefer cottonwoods for breeding sites in the plains and aspen in the mountains (Jackson and Ouellet 2002).  They can be found in northern Arizona during their breeding season in Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998).  In Colfax County, New Mexico they are year-round residents in grazed and ungrazed rangeland consisting of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) (Goguen and Mathews 1998).  They may act as an indicator of habitat degradation in riparian forested areas in the Toiyabe Mountain range in central Nevada, particularly in degraded birch and willow dominated habitats (Warkkentin and Reed 1999).  They are restricted to lowland riparian woodlands in San Diego County, California (Jackson and Ouellet 2002).\r\n\r\nExcept for the spruce-fir zone, downy woodpeckers can be found in every type of forest and in a wide variety of habitats in the Southeast, including mature woodlands, second growth, residential areas, orchards, citrus groves, riparian woods, swamps, and roadside groves (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Simpson 1992, Kaufman 1996, Nicholson 1997).  However in New York, they use montane spruce-fir forests (Jackson and Ouellet 2002).  Downy woodpeckers favor middle-aged to mature woodlands, although they are tolerant of earlier successional stages.  They tend to prefer hardwoods, especially bottomlands, but may also inhabit uplands (Hammel 1992).  They are occasional breeders on North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands (Fussell and Lyons 1990) and do not occur on the Florida Keys (Robertson and Kushlan 1984). N.
