In the West, its range extends south through the mountains of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah.  In the east, it extends south along the Appalachians.  In the SWReGAP region it occurs naturally in Utah, where it is a common year-round, breeding resident in the mountains of northern and north-central parts of the state, including northern Wasatch, Bear River, Wellsville, Uinta, and Raft River Mountains (Behle 1958, Hayward et al. 1976, Behle 1981, Behle et al. 1985, Stauffer and Peterson 1985, Hewitt and Messmer 2000).  The southernmost known occurrence in Utah is on the Fishlake Plateau (Behle et al. 1985).  The Ruffed Grouse is very rare in Colorado.  It was first confirmed in the state by a hunting record in 1988, and juveniles have been found twice near the Colorado-Utah border in Moffat County, Colorado, possibly indicating breeding in the state (Bailey and Niedrach 1965; Andrews and Righter 1992; Kingery 1998).  It has been introduced into a small portion of northeast Nevada (Elko and White Pine Counties), which is disjunct from the remainder of its range (Alcorn 1988, Rusch et al. 2000), and it continues to be restocked there (Rusch et al. 2000).  Predicting occurrence in Nevada is confounded by these reintroductions (Ammon, pers. Comm., 2005).\r\n\r\nThe habitats used by the Ruffed Grouse vary across its range and depends on availability of cover types (Cade and Sousa 1985). In general, it is associated with deciduous and coniferous forests, especially those with poplar and aspens (Rusch et al. 2000).  Optimal habitat is continuous young growth forests with a reduction in overstory and an increase in sapling and shrubs (Anderson et al 1981).  Highest densities of this species are found in deciduous forests (Stauffer and Peterson 1985; Root 1988, Rusch et al. 2000).  It can be found in boreal forests but survival rates and densities are lower in these habitats than in deciduous forests (Rusch et al. 2000).  Coniferous forests may offer lower security from predators (Gullion 1970).  \r\n\r\nIn the Northeast, it is found in early-successional mixed deciduous-coniferous forests.  In the Midwest, aspen forests are associated with high densities of the species, but it can be found in oak-hickory-pine forests as well.  In the Northwest, Ruffed Grouse are associated with montane early-successional deciduous forests and riparian areas (Rusch et al. 2000).  Although the ruffed grouse is closely associated with aspen across most of its northern and western range and prefers deciduous trees when available, it does not have an obligatory relationship with aspen. It occurs in open areas and ravines within coniferous forests when aspen or other hardwood dominated forests are not available (Cade and Sousa 1985), such as in Idaho (Marshall 1946; Hungerford 1951).  In these areas, it feeds on shrubs from understory openings, including mountain ash (Sorbus scopulina), service berry (Amelelanchier alnifolia), mountain snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), and snowbrush (Ceanothus velutinus) (Marshal 1946; Hungerford 1953).  They are often seen foraging along grassy roadsides (Alsop 1991). \r\n\r\nIn the southeastern portion of its range, the Ruffed Grouse is associated with young mixed-deciduous forests, where important cover species include oak, poplar, hickory, and pine species (Rusch et al. 2000).  In Georgia, they prefer forests with a heavy understory, such as mountain laurel or rhododendron (GA-GAP). \r\n\r\nIn the southwest, the species prefers aspen (Populus tremuloides) forests and woodlands, mixed aspen-conifer forests, shrubby canyons, and streamsides or ravines with willows, birch, maple, or alder (Hungerford 1951; Phillips 1967; Hayward et al. 1976; Behle 1981; Stauffer and Peterson 1985).  It frequents open areas especially at peripheral clearings in alpine forests near streams (Behle et al. 1985) and can be found in cool drainage bottoms in late summer when conditions are hot and dry (Marshall 1946; Hungerford 1953).  It also has been found in Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests in northern Utah (Phillips 1967) and other dense or open conifererous forests in autumn (Stauffer and Peterson 1985).  In Grand Teton NP, WY males were found drumming in a riparian corridor of lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, and mixed cottonwood-conifer but aspen was either in the understory or in stands nearby (Buhler and Anderson 2001). \r\n\r\nMales \u201cdrum\u201d from atop a log, rock, or other elevated perch to attract mates and advertise ownership of their territories (Farrand 1983).  Drumming sites are usually in early-successional hardwood vegetation with high stem densities and at least some overstory vegetation (Rusch et al. 2000).  Nests, however, are placed in forests (usually hardwood or aspen) with an open understory (Rusch et al. 2000).  Ruffed Grouse build nests on the ground at the base of a tree, under a log, rock, or root, or in dense cover (Harrison 1975).  The first eggs are laid in April or May, depending on the latitude. Clutch size is 4-19 (generally 9-12). Incubation by the female lasts 23-24 days and the young are tended by the female.  Nestlings are precocial and downy and can fly in 10-12 days.  Quality brood habitats are relatively mesic, typically on north or east slopes in hilly terrain, or in riparian areas and include small forest openings with a substantial shrub component, aspen stands, and wet low-lying thickets (Rusch et al. 2000, Dessecker and McAuley 2001).  Broods break up in fall when young are about 84 days old and young disperse (Terres 1980).  This happens at about 120-125 days in Wisconsin (Small and Rusch 1989).  In Alberta, about 50% of young survived from fall to spring (Rusch and Keith 1971).  This species is single-brooded but females may renest of first nesting attempt is unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThis species is reported to occur from 1,372 m (Marshall 1946) to 2,952 m (Stauffer and Peterson 1985) in southern Idaho and Utah, but it will occur lower in other parts of range (Root 1988).  It migrates altitudinaly in winter in some areas, including Utah (Hungerford 1953; Behle et al. 1985). \r\n\r\nRusch et al. (2000) stated that larger patches of upland aspen and oak forests are superior to isolated or fragmented ones surrounded by agricultural areas.  However, they acknowledge that small clearing within forested patches (<0.4 ha) are important.  Cade and Sousa (1985) note the recommendation from biologists of minimum habitat area of 20 ha for isolated blocks of forest surrounded by unsuitable areas.\r\n\r\nIn winter it is found in the same habitats that it occupies during the summer, which are aspen habitats in much of its range.  Winter roost sites that offer insulation from cold are important and include conifers, dense hardwood saplings, or burrows in snow.  Snow must be loose and deep enough to burrow in, usually under deciduous trees (Rusch et al. 2000).  Dense stands of hardwood saplings or conifers are used when snow roosts are not available (Rusch et al. 2000).  Aspen is important as a winter food where snow cover is heavy (Cade and Sousa 1985).  Cold weather does not appear to be a limiting factor unless there is a lack of snow cover for roosting (Root 1988).\r\n\r\nN.
