Martof et al. (1980) states that they are normally absent from larger water bodies, flood zone pools or permanent ponds where fish are present. And, in inland locations, such as the mountains and possibly the piedmont, they are generally restricted to lowland hardwood forests near pools or streams (King 1939, Petranka 1998).  On Atlantic Coastal Plain of southeastern U.S., breeds in sloughs or backwater lowland areas along streams that frequently contain or are easily colonized by predatory fishes that opportunistically feed on amphibian larvae (Semlitsch 1988). Eggs may be laid in ponds when they are ice-covered if salamanders already are present in the pond (States et al. 1988). Adults are largely fossorial, remaining underground or under soil surface objects except during the breeding period (Wilson 1995).   Adults are most common in bottomland forests in adjoining floodplains, but they occur sporadically in upland forest and in mountainous regions where suitable breeding sites are available.  Adults may move 200m or more from ponds after breeding (Petranka 1998). Common in the mountains below 2500 ft and piedmont and restricted to localized populations in the coastal plain (King 1939, Martof et al. 1980).  Breeds in March-April in the north and December-February in the south.  Lays masses of up to 250 eggs (average <100); eggs of an individual females may be laid in one large mass or divided among several masses of about 50-90 eggs. Larvae hatch in 1-2 months, metamorphose in 2-4 months or sometimes overwinter in pond.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSPOSx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01090", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma maculatum", "ITIS_TSN": "173590", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104612", "common_name": "Spotted Salamander"}}
