They are most often associated with open canopy oak and pine forests with shallow temporary ponds, ditches, (Duellman and Schwartz 1958, Dodd 1994) and wet prairies of the southeastern coastal plain (Hamilton 1955, Pechmann et al. 1989). Preference is for areas with non-permanent water sources on well to poorly drained soils. They commonly seek refuge under downed materials or shallow depressions surrounded by vegetation including cabbage palm and saw palmetto habitats (Hamilton 1955, Duellman and Schwartz 1958). In subtropical Florida, these toads are most common in low elevation pinelands (Dodd 1994)(quoted directly from Lannoo 2005).\r\nThe species breeds in shallow cypress and flatwood ponds and various vernal environments. Habitat of oak toads generally encompass herbaceaous areas of pine and oak savannas or flatwoods, maritime forests, and  tropical hammocks. This species also inhabits some barrier islands in South Carolina.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aOATOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01130", "scientific_name": "Anaxyrus quercicus", "ITIS_TSN": "773528", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102537", "common_name": "Oak Toad"}}
