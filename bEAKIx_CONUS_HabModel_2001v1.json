It is a fairly common breeder on the eastern plains of Colorado and less common in western valleys (Andrews and Righter 1992).  It is fairly common in the lowland valleys of northern Utah (Hayward 1976) and an infrequent summer visitor in northern Nevada (Alcorn 1988).  It breeds in the upper Rio Grande valley, as well as in northeastern and northwestern parts of New Mexico (Ligon 1961, Murphy 1996).  This species winters in South America (Murphy 1996).\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Kingbird is a woodland savannah and open savannah bird.  It nests in dead stumps and snags in swamps and marshes, shrubby streambanks, fields with scattered shrubs and trees, orchards shelterbelts, and along woodland edges in forested regions (Murphy 1996).  However, given suitable nesting conditions it will use other open habitat types such as aspen, parkland, recently burned forest, beaver ponds, golf courses, and forested river valleys and urban environments with tall trees and scattered open spaces (Murphy 1996).  Georgia GAP cited studies that showed it occupies the middle of the range between open agriculture devoid of trees and dense forest.  It is often seen on utility wires and along roads and fences in farm country.  Hadidian et. al (1997) found that Eastern Kingbirds are common breeders in Washington, DC across a variety of land uses, from low to high density residential areas to parks and industrial areas.  They reportedly prefer open areas near ponds (Murphy 1996).  Eastern Kingbirds tend to be more closely associated with riparian and deciduous woodlands in close proximity to open water than agricultural areas in Colorado (Kingery 1998).  Where they are also associated with riparian woodlands, in which they often utilize cottonwoods (Populus spp.) and elms (Ulmus spp.) for nesting sites (Kingery 1998).  They occasionally nest in pinyon-juniper woodlands and shrublands (Andrews and Righter 1992).  \r\n\r\nIn terrestrial areas, they nest in trees in open habitats.  Commonly used trees include hawthorn (Cratageus spp.), apple (Malus), elm (Ulmus), mulberry, osage orange (Maclura pomifera), and Norway spruce (Picea abies) and hawthorns are preferred in New York State (Murphy 1996).  Elsewhere, and less commonly, they use cottonwood and aspen (Populus spp.), oak (Quercus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), maple (Acer spp.), and locust (Gleditsia).  When they nest near water, they commonly use ironwood (Carpinus caroliniana), white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), or dead snags (Murphy 1996).  Their nests average 10 to 20 feet above the ground and are usually well out from the trunk on a limb (Potter et al. 1980).  Odd nest site locations such as on top of a fencepost, in martin gourds, rain gauges, and old oriole nests are sometimes found (Kaufman 1996, Potter et al 1980).  \r\n\r\nData on the distance into forests at which kingbirds can nest is lacking. \r\n\r\nThe lowest elevation in the southwest is 22 m and the highest is 2,743 m in Colorado (Schrupp and Cade 1989, NatureServe 2004).  Murphy (1996) reported that Eastern Kingbirds are rarely found at elevations over 1,300 m.\r\n\r\nLimited research suggests an average home range size of 20.7 acres (Schoener 1968).  N.
