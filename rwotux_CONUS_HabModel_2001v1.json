Nesting wood turtles require loose substrate on fully exposed (unshaded) sites, such as sandy banks or sand-gravel bars in streams. When natural openings are unavailable they may use such man-made disturbances as road grades, railroad grades, sand pits, or plowed fields (Harding 1990).\r\nTurtles commonly enter streams at night and individuals occur mainly in streams in spring and fall. Some agricultural operations may be locally beneficial by providing a mixture of different food and cover types near wooded streams (Kaufmann 1992). Wood turtles overwinter in bottoms or banks of streams where water flows all winter, including pools underneath a layer of ice; underwater muskrat burrows, beaver lodges, or over-bank root systems also may be used as winter hibernation (brumation) sites (Ernst 1986).\r\n\r\nIn general, habitats for the wood turtle include:  along permanent streams during much of each year but in summer may roam widely overland and can be found in a variety of terrestrial habitats adjacent to streams, including deciduous woods, cultivated fields, and woodland bogs, marshy pastures. Use of woodland bogs and marshy fields is most common in the northern part of the range (Ernst 1986). Wood turtles are often associated with the margins of woods and occupy forest edges to balance thermoregulatory and feeding needs (Compton et al. 2002). Western populations are closely associated with water year-round, and eastern populations tend to be more terrestrial in the summer. Hatchlings and small juveniles are much more closely associated with water than are adults (Ernst 1992).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWOTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAD02020", "scientific_name": "Glyptemys insculpta", "ITIS_TSN": "668669", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100280", "common_name": "Wood Turtle"}}
