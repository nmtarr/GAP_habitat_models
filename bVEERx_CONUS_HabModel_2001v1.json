The Veery is a long distance migrant that winters in south central and southeastern Brazil (Bevier et al. 2005).  In the Southwest Regional GAP area, the Veery is a breeding resident found in eastern-central Arizona in the Little Colorado River area, central Colorado, northern New Mexico, and northern Utah (Bevier et al. 2005). \r\n\r\nVeeries generally inhabit damp, deciduous and mixed deciduous/coniferous forests and woodlands as well as chaparral shrublands (Bevier te al. 2005, NatureServe 2009).  In some regions, they are associated with early successional habitats while in others they are found in moist portions of mature forests.  Shrub cover is the chief vegetative consideration in habitat selection probably because shrubs provide safe nest sites; usually woods with deciduous trees or shrubs, often in or near swampy, open, and/or moist areas with shrubby understory but also in mixed deciduous/coniferous woods, second growth, and willow or alder shrubbery near water (Bevier et al. 2005, NatureServe 2009).  This preference for habitats with dense shrubbery or understory, likely drives much of this species\u2019 association with disturbed habitats.  In mature woodlands, moisture regime is the chief factor in habitat selection, more than twice as important as herb cover (Bertin 1977).\r\n\r\nVeeries in New York State select shrubby or early successional habitats.  In Wisconsin, they are found in forests with dense understories and maple, oak, birch, plum, aspen, spruce, fir, pine, and hemlock species. In Vermont, Veeries only breed in deciduous forests, and in southern Quebec, they breed in sugar maple-basswood, sugar maple-yellow birch, and sugar maple-yellow birch-balsam fir forests or woodlands. They are present but least abundant in white spruce-balsam fir and black spruce -balsam fir-moss habitats (Bevier et al. 2005).  Breeding has been documented in maple swamp forests in Rhode Island.  Veeries are only found above 300 m in West Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn mid-Atlantic Piedmont forests of Delaware, nests were distributed non-randomly in relation to vegetation density -- characterized by dense foliage below 1.5 m with sparse overstory at 2.5 to 3 m and sites generally were within moist forests in floodplains and on south- and east-facing slopes (Bevier et al. 2005).\r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, Veeries are found only in the Southern Appalachian Mountains at high elevations (over 900m).  They are found primarily near water in damp deciduous forests with a dense understory and ground cover (Bevier et al.  2005). Forest types that are used include northern hardwood-beech forests, birch-maple forests, spruce-fir, and oak forests (Potter et al. 1980, Bevier et al. 2005). They are found in open mature forests, but restricted to brushy areas along water (Kaufman 1996).  \r\n\r\nIn the Great Plains, Veeries show a strong preference for riparian habitats and they are often associated with Beaver (Castor canadensis) wetlands (Bevier et al. 2005).\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, the Veery occurs in moist, dense riparian areas with willow carrs, dogwoods, and cottonwood saplings (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998).  They also inhabit drier hillside brush near streams and in aspen forests (Andrews and Righter 1992).  The maximum elevation at which Veeries are found in Colorado is 3000 m (Bevier et al. 2005).\r\n\r\nThe Veery is considered an area sensitive species but some studies have failed to detect any area sensitivity (Bevier 2005, NatureServe 2009).  In a study from Illinois, nesting occurred in forest patches as small as 27 ha but only two of 22 patches that were used were smaller than 100 ha and patches used for nesting tended to be surrounded by other forested habitat (Herkert 1995).  In Wisconsin, nesting was much more likely in forest patches larger than 100 ha than in smaller patches (Temple, cited by Herkert 1995).  Robbins et al. (1989) found that nesting in the mid-Atlantic states was most likely in forest patches of 3000 ha or larger but breeding sometimes occurred in patches as small as 9 ha. Breeding was associated with aspen groves that were over 8 ha in Saskatchewan (Johns 1993).  In red maple swamps of Rhode Island, Veeries occurred in swamps as small as 1 ha (Beveir et al. 2005 citing Golet et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nHabitat selection is often dependent upon the presence of other thrushes within parts of the breeding range, such as in northeastern mountains (Bevier et al.  2005). Competition with other thrushes is a key criterion in habitat selection by the Veery (Bevier et al. 2005) and can create interspecific, spatial segregration along elevational gradients or habitat types, although substantial spatial overlapping of contiguous species still occurs.  In the presence of other thrushes, the Veery will often select a broader range of habitats with varying successional stages (Bevier et al. 2005). \r\n\r\nIn migration and winter this species occurs also in lowland forest, woodland, and scrub (Bevier et al. 2005)", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bVEERx", "ELCode": "ABPBJ18080", "scientific_name": "Catharus fuscescens", "ITIS_TSN": "179796", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103031", "common_name": "Veery"}}
