It prefers habitats with scattered trees or shrubs with telephone wires, fences, and other conspicuous perches over habitats without these features and prefers short, grassy to nearly bare substrate when foraging on the ground (Derrickson and Breitwisch 1992, Stevenson and Anderson 1994).  \r\n\r\nMockingbirds are known to use forest edges, but not the interiors (Derrickson and Breitwisch 1992).  However, the distances into forests where they occur is unknown . They are rare in extensive marshes and prairies where trees or shrubs are lacking.  An association with residential or rural country has been reported for the Southeast and New Mexico (Hamel 1992, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  Hamel (1992) reported that they are most common in towns, suburbs, and roadsides.\r\n\r\nThis species can be found in Colorado in agricultural areas with scattered trees, shrublands, riparian areas, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and cholla grasslands (Andrews and Righter 1992).  It will avoid dense, extensive tracts of forestland but will utilize woodlands of pinyon-juniper, timbered prairie streams, woodlots, orchards, tree patches, and other wooded areas adjacent to more open space (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  In New Mexico, summer distribution extends from the lowest and most arid sections into the semi-forested mountain area of the north (Ligon 1961).  In Nevada, it is a permanent resident in desert scrub and riparian areas and a summer resident in woodlands (Alcorn 1988).  It is uncommon to common in Utah during the summer and more abundant in the southern part of the state (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). \r\n\r\nNorthern Mockingbirds are known for their territoriality, and most individuals stay on their territory year-round (Derrickson and Breitwisch 1992).  Schoener (1968) reported a mean home range size was reported of 1.0 acre.  No individuals are known to breed on their natal site and immature birds can disperse up to 200 miles. \r\n\r\nNorthern Mockingbirds occur from 0 to 2,440 m in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002), and up to 2,713 m in Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992).\r\n\r\nN.
