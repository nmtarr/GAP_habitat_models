It is a common summer resident in Nevada (NatureServe 2003) and breeds locally in northern Utah and southern New Mexico.  The species is an uncommon to common transient in most of the Southwestern lowlands in April and May and again in August through October.  It is one of many shorebird species that use western Great Basin wetlands as breeding and migratory stopover sites and must adjust to variable conditions (Johnsgard 1992). \r\n\r\nAmerican Avocets inhabit the borders of muddy, saline, alkaline, freshwater ponds, lakes and marshes; particularly favoring shallow alkaline lakes, wet meadows, and pastures with scattered open pools.  Alkali flats are especially preferred (Alcorn 1988).  They spend most time in shallow water or in open areas with glasswort (Salicornia spp.), salt grass (Distichlis spp.), and even greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.) within wetlands characterized by common cattail (Typha latifolia), bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), or sedges (Carex spp.; Robinson et al. 1997).  In desert wetlands, especially in Utah, avocets nest along the lake shoreline among scattered patches of vegetation, along barren mud flats, on small patches of vegetation over water, and among scattered patches of salt grass and on open salt pans near playas (Robinson et al. 1997).  \r\n\r\nDuring breeding, this species favors ponds or shallow lakes with exposed and sparsely vegetated shorelines and somewhat saline waters that have large populations of aquatic invertebrates (DeGraff and Rappole 1995). Breeding occurs on sewage ponds near urbanized areas (Robinson et al. 1997).\r\n\r\nThey place nests on dry, sun baked mudflats near water, on low gravelly or sandy islands with scant vegetation, on sparsely vegetated dikes, or in marshes bordering shallow lakes (Davis 1997).  In desert wetlands, nests can be placed up to 20 m from water (Robinson et al. 1997).  Elsewhere, distances of up to 300 m have been documented between nests and water but most nests were < 50 m from water (Robinson et al. 1997). \r\n\r\nWinter habitat includes shallow lakes, riverbanks with sand bars and wet meadows and do not use upland or dry habitats (Davis 1997, Cole et al. 2002).  In Utah, they use intertidal mudflats and brackish water impoundments (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003).  Robinson et al. (1997) reported that they used tidal flats between mangroves (Laguncularia sp.) and impounded settling ponds rimmed with knotgrass (Paspalum vaginatum) and saltbush (Baccharis sp.) in Florida; intertidal mudflats, sewage ponds, and mudflats (for roosting) in Humboldt Bay, CA; and they preferred areas of shallow water over soft silt within impoundments versus natural mudflats in coastal South Carolina.
