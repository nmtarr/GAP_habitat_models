The range includes all rivers from southern Georgia, northwestern Florida, to west Louisiana, and eastern Texas. Also the river systems of southeastern Iowa, Illinois, southern Indiana, and southeastern Kansas (Boundy and Kennedy 2006; Conant and Collins 1991; Jensen and Birkhead 2003; Johnson 1989; Lovich 1993).\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil. Preferred habitats consist of slow-moving streams, deep waters of rivers, sloughs, oxbows, canals, and minor streams. Also found in ponds near rivers, shallow creeks, tributaries, swift upland streams, impoundments, and bayous (Ernst et al. 2004; Natureserve.org; Phelps 2004). Generally, alligator snapping turtles occupy river mouths, tidal rivers, big rivers, but also deep and shallow water pools. Riparian habitats include forested wetland, although rare to find them outside of the water except for nesting (Natureserve.org). This species is found under or in logjams, under rock shelter, in deep holes, or beneath undercut banks (Jensen et al. 2008).\r\n\r\n\u201cAlligator snapping turtles tend to be distributed in a more or less linear fashion along riverine systems, with most nesting on high ground in streamside locations\u201d (Jackson and Ewert 1994 (as referenced by Natureserve.org)).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rASTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAB02010", "scientific_name": "Macrochelys temminckii", "ITIS_TSN": "668671", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102590", "common_name": "Alligator Snapping Turtle"}}
