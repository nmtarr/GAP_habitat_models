Found in trees and shrubs in residential areas (NatureServe 2004). Prefers open woodlands with some evergreen foliage or shrubby understory (Sloane 2001). Also found in second growth and riparian and canyon areas in xeric habitats as long as the area contains well-spaced trees or shrubs (Sloane 2001). Prefers oak-pine forests in the mountains (Sloane 2001). Seen in aspen, commonest in open woodlands (Johnsgard 1992). In Colorado, occurs primarily in pinyon-juniper woodlands, riparian and upland shrublands, rarely in orchards; often in rabbitbrush in fall (Andrews and Righter 1992). Upper Sonoran woodlands, chaparral, fir forests, and scrub oaks in Arizona (Phillips et al. 1964). Its habitats are mainly juniper and pinyon forests but it also utilizes oak scrub and other brushy habitats in Utah (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 2003). Throughout in New Mexico except absent from lowland areas and higher mountain ranges (Sloane 2001).  Found at elevations of 180-3,505 m in interior North America and in Mexico and central America (Sloane 2001).  In Chiricahua Mountains, southeastern Arizona, nests at all elevations below approximately 3,000 m, with the exception of open desert (Sloane 2001). Occurs between 1,220 and 2,439 m in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).\r\nIn California, occurs everywhere except extreme high elevations and open desert. In Marin Co., prefers sunny edges of woods and open areas with some trees and shrubs. Although found foraging even in dense conifer forest, more often inhabits areas with broad-leaved evergreen shrubs (such as coyote bush [Baccharis pilularis] and Ceanothus spp.) and oak woodland (Shuford 1993). Resident on Santa Cruz Island (Grinnell and Miller 1944, McCaskie et al. 1979, Garrett and Dunn 1981).\r\nIn Chiricahua Mtns., se. Arizona, nests at all elevations and in all habitats below approximately 3,000 m, with the exception of open desert. These include open juniper woodland, pine-oak woodland, wooded riparian areas, and arid riparian areas at 1,000 m (quoted directly from Sloane 2001).\r\nNorthwest:\r\nFound in a large variety of habitats, ranging from forested mountains to arid brush. In general, in all parts of its range prefers open mixed woodland with some evergreen foliage or shrubby understory (e.g., woodlands such as pi\u00f1on [Pinus spp.]-juniper [Juniperus spp.], pine-oak [Quercus spp.], and juniper-pine-oak). Also found in second growth and riparian and canyon areas in xeric habitats as long as the area contains well-spaced trees or shrubs. Also found in coastal chaparral (largely evergreen, sclerophylous shrub vegetation), coastal sage scrub (summer-deciduous shrub vegetation), and other shrub habitats. Adapts readily to suburban and edge environments. Avoids open desert. Ranges from sea level at the coast of North America to primarily mid- to high elevations in interior North America and in Mexico and central America (180\u20133,505 m; Harrap and Quinn 1995). In n. California and Oregon, most often in brushy habitats (e.g., chaparral, residential areas, and second growth; Gilligan et al. 1994). In Washington, originally found only in coastal areas around Puget Sound but has expanded its range inland and onto some islands in Puget Sound as conifer forests of the region have been replaced by suburban residential areas and shrubby second growth. A few isolated populations occur in central part of state, possibly established in early 1990s. In these areas, nests can be found in dense riparian areas associated with honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.)(Smith et al. 1997)(quoted directly from Sloane 2001).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBUSHx", "ELCode": "ABPAY01010", "scientific_name": "Psaltriparus minimus", "ITIS_TSN": "178764", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102220", "common_name": "Bushtit"}}
