They prefer open woodlands and brushy growth interspersed with trees and isolated streamside groves.  They are usually absent from coniferous forests and woodlands, but use these habitats in some areas (see below; Ellison 1992).  These gnatcatchers are typically confined to riparian or lakeside habitats at the northern edge of their range, but at least one study in this region failed to find a preference for riparian habitats (Ellison 1992, Robinson and Robinson 1999).\r\n\r\nIn the Northeast, they are generally confined to lowland deciduous and mixed forests especially near rivers and lakes but are also found in upland areas.  They use floodplain forests dominated by green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and silver maple (Acer saccharinum) in southwestern Vermont (Ellison 1992).\r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, they breed primarily in moist deciduous forests, such as bottomland, riparian, and swamp forests, excluding mangroves.  Hamel et al. (1982) reported that they are seldom far from water and avoid coniferous woodlands and forests. But this may not be the case.  Ellison (1992) stated that they can be found in upland deciduous woodlands and pine flatwoods with oak understories (Ellison 1992).  Furthermore, Turner et. al (2002) found Blue-gray Gnatcatchers to be common in mesic pine stands that were approximately 20 years old while uncommon in a matrix of pines <20 years old.  Pine stands are also used in the Ouchita Mountains (Barber et al. 2001).  On the Ozark Plateau, they are found in both dry and moist forests but are more frequent in moist forests.  In Florida, breeding habitats include cypress forests, loblolly and short leaf pine woodlands, scrub and second-growth hardwoods, subtropical woodlands, swamps, and heavily wooded residential areas (Robertson and Kushlan 1984, Hunter 1990).  \r\n\r\nRobinson and Robinson (1999) reported that Blue-gray Gnatcatchers were equally abundant in early successional habitats on ridges and in ravines at study sites in Illinois.  Therefore distance to streams may not influence distribution in the upper Midwest region.  Along the upper St. Croix River, WI, they breed in silver maple-black ash (Fagus nigra) and swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor)-black ash forests (Ellison 1992).\r\n\r\nThroughout the west, this species is a common breeding bird in the oak and pinyon-juniper woodlands.  In the Southwest, Blue-gray Gnatcatchers breed in a broad range of habitats from shrublands to mature forest, generally associating with broad-leaved trees or shrubs.  They are also found in riparian and swamp forests.  Other habitats include oak and pine-oak woodlands, chaparral, manzanitas, junipers stands, Arizona cypress stands, and Chihuahua pine stands in Arizona (Marshall, 1957, Phillips et al., 1964), pinyon-juniper woodlands and riparian cottonwood and willow stands in the Great Basin (Pavlacky et al., 2001), pinyon-juniper woodlands, scrub-oak thickets, mountain mahogany, and serviceberry shrubs as well as sagebrush and ponderosa pine when either pinyon-juniper or scrub oak is nearby in Colorado (Andrews and Righter, 1992).  ), Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), rock outcrops, and shrubs in the Rosaceae family in southwestern Wyoming (SWreGAP 2005),  willows, sycamores, and cottonwoods along streams and chaparral in the upper Sonoran zone of Arizona, pinyon-juniper habitat in northeastern New Mexico (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma; Ligon, 1961), and, riparian habitats and blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodlands in the interior coast ranges of California, occurring sparingly in adjacent chaparral (Ellison 1992).\r\n\r\nBlue-gray Gnatcatchers breed in riparian woodlands and upland deciduous and mixed forests in south-central states (Ellison 1992).\r\n\r\nIn northeastern U.S., probability of occurrence is maximum with tracts over 3000 Ha (Robbins et al. 1989).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, Blue-gray Gnatcatchers inhabit cypress swamps with broadleaf understory, sub-tropical hammocks, pine flatwoods, citrus orchards, Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), and ornamental plantings in southern Florida.  In the Southwest, they occur in shrublands on dry, sunny slopes or along open streams (SWreGAP 2005).  In Arizona, they will inhabit screwbean mesquite (Prosopis pubescens; SWreGAP 2005).  In western Mexico, wintering habitats include mangroves, gallery forests, thornscrub, evergreen and deciduous forests, and oak and oak-pine woodlands from sea level to highlands, but not exclusively coniferous forest (Ellison 1992).
