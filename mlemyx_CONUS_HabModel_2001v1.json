Nevertheless, M. evotis has been documented ground roosting in rock crevices within grassland, but within an average distance of 13 m from forest edge. In instances where the species has been documented in sagebrush or greasewood habitats, it was in close proximity to juniper woodlands and/or cliffs for roosting habitat (Finley et al., 1983; Jackson and Herder, 1997).\r\n\r\nThe long-eared myotis forages over stock tanks, ponds and lakes, rivers (Black, 1974; Worthington, 1991; Fitzgerald et al., 1994; Lausen, 2007). Roosting occurs in rock outcrops and cliffs (Jones et al., 1973; Holloway, 1998; Rancourt et al., 2005), ground roosts in rock (Holloway, 1998; Rabe et al., 1998; Solick, 2004; Lausen, 2007), under the sloughing bark of snags and stumps (Vonhof and Barclay, 1997; Rabe et al., 1998; Waldien et al., 2000; Solick, 2004; Rancourt et al., 2005), and in caves and mines (Hendricks, 2000). In one study, the species selected stumps within a clearcut, presumably for the thermal benefits (Vonhof and Barclay, 1997). Hibernation is typically within caves (Marcot, 1984).\r\n\r\nIn some studies, the species has been shown to roost farther from water sources than expected (Waldien et al., 2000; Rancourt et al., 2005), while others have shown highly significant affinities for water (Waldien and Hayes, 2001). In no study did roost sites average greater than 590 m from permanent water sources (Marcot, 1984; Holloway, 1998; Waldien et al., 2000; Waldien and Hayes, 2001; Rancourt et al., 2005; Lausen, 2007; Nixon et al., 2009). Likewise, an individual\u2019s roost site and foraging sites averaged 518 m apart (Waldien and Hayes, 2001), with a reported maximum distance of 600 m (SW GAP).\r\n\r\nM. evotis\u2019 elevational limits range from near sea level along the Pacific coast (Maser et al., 1981; California Wildlife Habitat Relationships System) to 3600 m (Findley et al., 1975), with published occurrences in excess of 2700 m (Mollhagen and Bogan, 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLEMYx", "ELCode": "AMACC01070", "scientific_name": "Myotis evotis", "ITIS_TSN": "179995", "Global_SEQ_ID": "798516", "common_name": "Long-eared Myotis"}}
