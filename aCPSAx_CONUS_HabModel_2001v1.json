They are occasionally found in sandstone/shale rock outcrops and rock crevices.  They use fallen logs, leaf litter, and debris as cover.  This species is similar to P. glutinosus, with which it is usually sympatric.  Populations reach their highest densities on west facing slopes (Baily and Pauley 1993).  They were regarded as conspecific with P. glutinosus until 1983 (Highton and MacGregor 1983).  They are terrestrial breeders that deposit eggs in July.   Mean clutch size is 10 with individual females reproducing bienially or less frequently.  Hatching occurs in October.  Males are sexually mature in 3-4 years after hatching.  Females are probably sexually mature at 4-5 years after hatching.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCPSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12260", "scientific_name": "Plethodon kentucki", "ITIS_TSN": "173661", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105464", "common_name": "Cumberland Plateau Salamander"}}
