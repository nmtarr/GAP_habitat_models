Habitats of observation include: subalpine parklands dominated by ponderosa pine, aspen, and Englemann spruce (Armstrong et al., 1973); mixed conifer forests of ponderosa pine, juniper, spruce, white fir, douglas-fir, aspen, and gambel oak (Durrant and Lee, 1955; Clothier, 1957; Jones, 1961; Spencer and Pettus, 1966; Armstrong et al., 1973; Berna, 1990; George, 1990; Hafner and Stahlecker, 2002); narrow, wooded canyons with pinyon pine, gambel oak, and cottonwood (Armstrong et al., 1973); open ponderosa pine woodlands with scattered oak and pinyon pine (Armstrong et al., 1973); talus slopes and rockslides (Mickey, 1948; Clothier, 1957; Hoffman and Taber, 1960; Brown, 1967; Hoffman et al., 1969); alpine tundra (Clothier, 1957; Hoffman and Taber, 1960; Brown, 1967); sagebrush-steppe with antelope bitterbrush and serviceberry (MacCracken et al., 1985; Kirkland et al., 1997); montane/subalpine marsh and meadow (Spencer and Pettus, 1966); clearcuts (Spencer and Pettus, 1966); and dry short-grass prairie (Cinq-Mars et al., 1979). The species\u2019 apparent absence from pinyon-juniper woodlands, foothill shrub and grasslands, etc. are perhaps a result of the species\u2019 elusive nature (Brown, 1967; Hoffman and Owen, 1980) rather than its actual absence.\r\n\r\nA single decayed S. nanus corpse has been observed in a stubble field in South Dakota; however the taxonomic identification was in doubt (Baker and Findley, 1953; Phillips, 1956), and no additional individuals have been documented in comparable habitat.\r\n\r\nSurveys have not detected the species at mid-elevation pinyon-juniper woodlands or shrublands (Armstrong et al., 1973)\r\n\r\nThe species has been captured at elevations as low as 1676 m in Colorado (Spencer and Pettus, 1966) and 1400 in Montana (Thompson, 1977). Based on the location description by Martin (1971), a an individual in South Dakota has been captured at an elevation near 900 m. The highest elevation at which the species has been observed was in Montana, at over 3300 m (Hoffman and Taber, 1960).\r\n\r\nS. nanus tolerates greater distances to water than its congeners. Spencer and Pettus (1966) found dwarf shrew an average of 36 m from water, and Clothier (1957) reported individuals 800 m from water.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mDWSHx", "ELCode": "AMABA01130", "scientific_name": "Sorex nanus", "ITIS_TSN": "179951", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104880", "common_name": "Dwarf Shrew"}}
