Seldom occurring in open areas, they are mainly restricted to woodland habitats, often in riparian areas. They are most common in cool, damp forests with moss-covered rocks. This mouse is a resident of cool, moist woodlands. However, ecotones with more open, herbaceous habitats in moist settings are used as well (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Open situations in conifer (primarily spruce-fir or hemlock) or mixed conifer and northern hardwood forest, rhododendron thickets, and rocky areas near water appear to be where the species reaches its highest population densities (Lee et al. 1982, Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). It also occurs in bog conditions (Webster et al. 1985). Nests are made in underground chambers, in piles of brush, or under fallen trees (Webster et al. 1985). Trani et al. (2007) list the following vegetative communities as suitable: high elevation forest, Appalachian oak forest, and mixed mesophytic forest. They also associate them with bogs/fens, forested wetlands, and riparian habitats. Trani et al. (2007) describe habitat and this species' association with water as follows: \"The woodland jumping mouse inhabits high-elevation forests that include red spruce-fir (Picea rubens-Abies spp.), maple-beech-birch (Acer-Fagus-Betula), cove hardwood, white pine-hemlock (Pinus strobus-Tsuga spp.) and oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya). It is often suggested to be restricted to cool moist environments and many studies have reported it in association with streams, bogs, and swamps (Wrigley 1972, Whitaker et al. 1975). In the southern portions of its range, its occurrence in mesic forests may confound the importance of nearby water. McShea et al. (2003) found that the closer non-mesic sampling sites were to mesic patches the more likely the presence of N. insignis. Other studies report no particular association with habitats near water (Connor 1960, Whitaker 1963) but suggested the importance of ground cover. Dense herbaceous ground cover, (e.g. sedges, grasses, and low woody vegetation), which is often more abundant near water, as well as structural debris, including logs and moss covered rocks, appear to be important in its micro-habitat selection (Whitaker 1963, Brower and Cade 1966, Wrigley 1972).\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWJMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFH02010", "scientific_name": "Napaeozapus insignis", "ITIS_TSN": "180390", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105732", "common_name": "Woodland Jumping Mouse"}}
