Isolated populations from the main range are found in northern Baja California (Grismer 2002; Rossman et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003). \r\n \r\nThis species burrows in or using soil, decaying logs, and fallen debris. Its habitat includes herbaceous wetland, low to moderate gradient creeks and rivers, shallow water pools. Also riparian zones, grassland, chaparral, bare rock, talus, scree, shrubland, and conifer, hardwood, mixed woodland. Populations are found in lowlands to high mountains, and open forest areas (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nNW\t-Cover is provided by densely vegetated patches of shrubs and grasses found along creeks, rivers, ponds, and lakes.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rTEGAx", "ELCode": "ARADB36050", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis elegans", "ITIS_TSN": "174142", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102240", "common_name": "Terrestrial Gartersnake"}}
