This species occurs from just under 900m to over 1400m in altitude. Observed in southern Oklahoma, southeastern New Mexico, and most of Texas. In Mexico, occupies the northern regions of Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas (Jones and Lovich 2009). Conant and Collins (1998) describe it as a lizard of river floodplains, prairie grasslands, washes, grassland-brush crossings, and rocky hillsides of the Texas panhandle, southeastern New Mexico, south Oklahoma, as well as northern portions of Veracruz, Mexico. \r\n\r\nThe range of the common spotted whiptail expands across shortgrass prairies, shrubland, riparian areas, plateaus, and rocky hillsides of the Red River Valley through the Oklahoma and Texas border. In New Mexico, has been reported to range in altitude from 900m to about 1300m in the Eddy and Lea counties. Also, occupies both sides of the Sierra Madre Oriental and well into Aguascalientes, Queretaro, Mexico (Degenhardt et al. 1996). The common spotted whiptail can be frequently found in prairie grasslands, but also in washes, and river bottoms grown to mesquite, acacia, shrubs, and cacti. Its range comprises north Texas to north Veracruz; east Texas to southeast New Mexico (Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nSW\r\n\tDense mesquite, short grass prairies, salt cedar and alkali sacaton.
