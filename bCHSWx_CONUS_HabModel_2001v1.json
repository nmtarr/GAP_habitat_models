In the Southwest Regional GAP area, the Chimney Swift can be found breeding in eastern Colorado and on the fringes of eastern New Mexico (Cink and Collins 2002).  Its wintering areas include western Peru, northern Chile, and the upper Amazon basin of eastern Peru and Brazil (NatureServe 2004). \r\n\r\nChimney Swifts spend most of the day foraging for flying insects high over any type of habitat but frequently over residential areas, woodlands, and other open habitats (Kaufman 1996).  All foraging, courting, and mating are performed in the air (Kingery 1998).  They roost and nest inside air shafts, chimneys, and vacant buildings, old cisterns, silos, rafters, and wells (Nicholson 1997, NatureServe 2010) and their frequent presence around human habitation is related to the availability of such sites.  In undeveloped areas, Chimney Swifts roost and nest in hollow trees, caves, tree cavities, sinkholes, and other similar features (Kaufman 1996, Cink and Collins 2002).  \r\n\r\nNew York State, some individuals foraged 3\u20136 km away (Cink and Collins 2002).\r\n\r\nMost observations of Chimney Swifts in Colorado have been reported in urban areas (Kingery 1998), but they also forage for flying, aquatic, and terrestrial invertebrates over crop fields, cottonwood stream bottoms, forests, open country, ponds and lakes, and anywhere else insects concentrate (Kingery 1998, Cink and Collins 2002). \r\n\r\nOver the entire breeding distribution range elevational limits are unknown (Cink and Collins 2002), but in Colorado this species breeds at elevations of 914-1980m (Colorado Wildlife Species Database (Schrupp and Cade 1989).
