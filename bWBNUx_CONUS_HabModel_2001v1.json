It also uses other partially open habitats like pinyon-juniper, clearings, forest edges, parks, and open areas with scattered trees.  Nests are built at heights between 5-15 m above the ground in natural tree cavities, old woodpecker holes, and birdhouses (Nature Serve 2010).\r\n\r\nIn the northern Great Plains, they inhabit riparian habitats and scattered ponderosa pine groves within prairies. In Wyoming, they occupy coniferous and deciduous woodlands and riparian forests and woodlands at low to middle elevations (Grubb and Pravosudov 2008). \r\n\r\nThey are found in Washington State\u2019s open-canopy ponderosa pine and Oregon white oak forests and in ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir zones in the eastern part of the state (Grubb and Pravosudov 2008). \r\n\r\nIn the Southwest, they are most frequent in open woodlands of mature trees, pinyon-juniper, clearings, forest edge, parks and partly open situations of scattered trees but also found in deciduous forests, riparian woods, and lower zones of coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1992, NatureServe 2004).  They are absent from the semiarid shrub and shrub-steppe of the Great Basin and Sonoran Desert (Grubb and Pravosudov 2008).  They generally inhabit mature deciduous woodland and mixed coniferous forest (Pravosudov and Grubb, Jr. 1993), and usually avoid boreal and spruce-fir forests (Andrews and Righter 1992, Pravosudov and Grubb, Jr. 1993).  They favor woodland edges over interiors, preferring open areas near the nest (Pravosudov and Grubb, Jr. 1993).  They are most common in ponderosa pine forests and pinyon-juniper woodlands (Andrews and Righter 1992) but are regular in foothills and lowland riparian forests (Andrews and Righter 1992) and in urban areas during the fall and the winter (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Colorado birds favor coniferous forests 4:1, almost exclusively the lower-elevation coniferous forests with secondary use of aspen and foothills with riparian habitats (Kingery 1988). They occur up to 3,050 m in Colorado (Kingery 1988).\r\n\r\nIn the southeastern U.S., White-breasted Nuthatches breed in deciduous or mixed forests, especially in mature uplands.  They can also be found in bottomlands, parks and residential areas with mature trees.  On the coastal plain they do breed in longleaf pine (GA citations).  Hamel (1992) lists it as uncommon to fairly common in the mountains below 5,000 ft., parts of the upper piedmont, and parts of the upper coastal plain, while uncommon to rare in the lower piedmont and lower coastal plain.  They are generally found in mature hardwood forests, but may also be breed in mixed deciduous and coniferous forests (Pravosudov and Grubb 1993). Kaufman (1996) states however they are \u2018rarely found in pure coniferous forest.'  Hamel (1992) suggests it is more numerous in upland hardwood forests, but may be in bottomlands as well, so long as mature trees are present. Often favors open areas or woodland edge provided by water, roads, or clearings near nests (Kaufman 1996, Pravosudov and Grubb 1993). Residential areas, campuses, and parks may also be used if they contain mature trees (Hamel 1992).  Nests are usually built in natural cavities or old woodpecker holes from 15 to 60 feet above the ground (Kaufman 1996). Hamel (1992) and Kaufman (1996) list the White-breasted nuthatch as sometimes excavating its own cavity, however Potter et al (1980) states this happens very rarely.  N.
