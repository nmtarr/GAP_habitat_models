It occurs in aspen, ponderosa pine, limber pine, bristlecone pine, spruce-fir, sagebrush, grama and buffalograss, cattail, cottonwood, alder, willow, sycamore, larkspur, monkshood, and aspen (Thompson et al. 1996,  New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, NatureServe 2003).  It is most abundant in streamside alder, willow, and aspen stands with well-developed understory of forbs and grasses (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  One was trapped in Baccharis and small willows (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The home range is 0.2ha (NatureServe 2003). It occurs at elevations of 1,850-3,500m (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996,  New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). P. zapus prefers moist soil (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It nests in burrows in well-drained mounds or banks (NatureServe 2003).  Hibernacula in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah were typically 50-60 cm below ground with an average soil temperature of 4-5 degrees C (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  Z. princeps occurs in central and western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found in western and northern Nevada (Zeveloff 1988, Hall 1995). The species is present only in the San Juan and Sangre de Cristo mountains in New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It is present in northwestern, central, and northeastern Utah (Durrant 1952, Zeveloff 1988). It occurs in the San Juan Mountains, Sangre de Cristos, Raft River Mountains, Beaver Mountains, Oquirrh Mountains, Uinta Mountains, and the Wasatch Mountains. In California, this species are confined to wet areas in a variety of coniferous forest, riparian, and grassland habitats, and can be locally abundant in thick, herbaceous vegetation near water. Refuges tend to be dense herbaceous cover near water with burrows constructed in moist soil. Winter hibernation nests consist of grass, leaves, and other vegetation, built underground, or beneath logs or brush piles ([Brylski et al. 2007 for CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Oregon, Z. princeps inhabits mountain meadows, particularly those adjacent to small streams, in some situations rarely ranging farther than 30 meters from the streamside though suitable habitat may exist beyond (Brown 1970, Verts and Carraway 1998). Tree genera present in preferred riparian habitats include Salix, Populus, Alnus, as well as Carex and various wetland forbs and grasses (Brown 1967, 1970, Vaughn and Weil 1980, Verts and Carraway 1998). In Grand Teton National Park, Clark (1971) trapped this species in lowland aspen and shrub-sedge-grass savannas less than 100 meters from standing water. In the Medicine Bow mountains of Wyoming, Brown (1967) caught Z. princeps in subalpine mountain meadows and willow-alder communities less than 183 meters from water (Verts and Carraway 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWEMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFH01020", "scientific_name": "Zapus princeps", "ITIS_TSN": "180387", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102879", "common_name": "Western Jumping Mouse"}}
