The western subspecies is \u201crestricted to narrow zones of riparian woodlands comprised of dense, closed-canopy cottonwood-willow\u201d (Laymon and Halterman, 1989; see also: Gaines, 1974; Gaines and Laymon, 1984).\r\n\r\nIn the eastern U.S. the species has a wider ecological tolerance. It occupies riparian thickets (Johnsgard, 1979), old fields overgrown with shrubs or saplings (Nolan, 1963; Johnsgard, 1979), pine plantations (Smith, 1979; Legrand et al., 2007), hardwood floodplain forest (Inman et al., 2002), upland forest (Inman et al., 2002), open woodlands (James and Neal, 1986; Palmer-Ball, 1996), bottomland mixed and hardwood forests (Dickson et al., 1980), and both uplands and wetlands (Hess et al., 2000; Inman et al., 2002).\r\n\r\nAlthough it tends to avoid closed canopy (Johnsgard, 1979; Palmer-Ball, 1996; Hughes, 1999), C. americanus has been documented under canopy cover of 80% (Comer et al., 2011), and its abundance was not correlated with canopy cover within the range of 54 to 74% (Inman et al., 2002). Nevertheless, Gale et al. (2001) noted the species arrival and increases in abundance coinciding with defoliation events.\r\n\r\nThe species also avoids areas devoid of trees or shrubs (Nolan, 1963; Krementz and Christie, 2000; Hotaling et al., 2002). It is rare to absent in conifer forests (Dickson et al., 1980; Gale et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2006), but is nonetheless present in pine plantations (Smith, 1979; Legrand et al., 2007).\r\n\r\nC. americanus has been found at elevations up to 1265 m in eastern Kentucky (Monroe and Zimmerman, 1994).\r\n\r\nGenerally thought to require 40 ha of contiguous habitat (Laymon and Halterman, 1989), yellow-billed cuckoos have been documented in patches as small as 3 ha (Gaines, 1974), with others documenting presence in patches as small as 4 ha (Galli et al., 1976; Wiggins, 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bYBCUx", "ELCode": "ABNRB02020", "scientific_name": "Coccyzus americanus", "ITIS_TSN": "177831", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105709", "common_name": "Yellow-billed Cuckoo"}}
