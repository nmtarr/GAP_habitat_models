It is usually associated with shallow water and adjacent hardwood vegetation.  In the Southwest it often occurs in riparian areas with adjacent mesquite and cottonwood vegetation types.  \r\n\r\nBrown (1985) suggests nests are usually near or adjacent to water, but may occur up to 3 km from a water source.  Selects primarily for shallow freshwater ponds and lakes, which may be devoid of emergent vegetation (James and Thompson 2001).  Aquatic habitat is characterized as \u201cquiet shallow water adjacent to dense scrub and large trees\u201d (Brown 1985).  High use areas are usually smaller and shallower and have more shoreline/ hectare of surface water and greater interspersion of emergent cover and open water than nonuse areas (James and Thompson 2001).  In Mexico, this species occurs in marshes, swampy forests, lagoons mangroves and flooded fields (Howell and Webb 1995).\r\n\r\nEmergent vegetation may be lacking but often pond/ lake areas contain water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), water lilies (Castalia sp.), and cattail (Typha spp.).  Surrounding areas are often savannas of live oak (Quercus virginiana) and mesquite (Prosopis chilensis), or Bermuda grass with areas of exposed mud (James and Thompson 2001).  Although this species requires large-diameter trees for nesting, it may occur within three kilometers of water.  Thus, it may nest wherever suitable habitat is present.  It is possible this duck will nest in other forest types, as well as riparian forest.  \r\n\r\nIt is primarily a cavity nester, this species less often nests on the ground (Howell and Webb 1995, James and Thompson 2001).  Nest cavities are often naturally formed and caused by disease, rot or limb break (James and Thompson 2001).  No information for tree species used in Arizona; presumably, large diameter riparian trees are required for nesting.   In Texas, BBWD nests in cavities of live oak, ebony, willow, elm, mesquite and hackberry.  \r\n\r\nNest height is approximately 63.8 cm (James and Thompson 2001).  Ground nests are defined as dense stands of emergent vegetation or exposed wetlands, with considerable amount of time required swimming in open water (James and Thompson 2001).  Breeding season seems to be timed with the height of the summer monsoons (Edison et al. 1995).  Distance to water does not appear to be important regarding nest site selection (James and Thompson 2001).  However, Brown (1985) suggests nests are usually near or adjacent to water, but may occur up to 3 km from a water source.  \r\n\r\nIt forages in agricultural fields near water, as well as shallow-water areas including shorelines and mudflats (James and Thompson 2001).  Proximity to farmland or irrigated pastures seems to be a requisite for occurrence (Brown 1985).  In Sinaloa, northwestern Mexico, stomach contents of 31 BBWD revealed that primary foods were cultivated grains (mostly rice, Kramer and Euliss 1986), which support claims made by Brown (1985).  Furthermore, the findings of Kramer and Euliss (1986) support claims by others that black-bellied whistling ducks consume mostly agricultural grains.  N.
