Can be found in the undergrowth or edge of mature or second growth deciduous and mixed forests, in disturbed areas, in fields with hedgerows, and developed areas near human habitation (Kaufman 1996, Nicholson 1997). Absent from high elevations and salt marshes (Potter et al. 1980).  They are also found in urban and suburban areas where overgrown lots, parks, or nearby woodlands provide habitat (Stevenson and Anderson 1994). They were reported as abundant in mature loblolly pine, longleaf pine and mature oak, gum, cypress stands in the southeast (Dickson et al. 1980). They will nest in any type of cavity, including natural tree cavities, old woodpecker holes, crevices among upturned roots of downed trees, birdhouses, crevices in buildings, ledges in outbuildings, or in the middle of a brushpile. Forages by gleaning insects and seeds on the ground, from foliage, and from bird feeders (Kaufman 1996). Average home range size was estimated at 0.3 acres (Brewer 1955, Schoener 1968).\r\nWide range of habitats, from brushy clearcuts and lowland cypress (Taxodium) swamps to hemlock- (Tsuga -) and rhododendron- (Rhododendron -) choked ravines (Dickson et al. 1984, Horn 1984, Mengel 1965). Habitat requirements include moderate to dense shrub or brushy cover (James 1971, Dickson and Noble 1978, Hamel et al. 1982, Conner et al. 1983, Breininger and Smith 1992). Inhabits 19 of 23 reported vegetation types in the se. U.S. Optimal vegetation types inhabited include: tropical hardwoods, southern scrub oak, sand pine-southern scrub oak, southern mixed mesic woods, bay-swamp pocosin, pond pine pocosin, oak-gum-cypress, live oak maritime, elm-ash-cottonwood, mixed pine-hardwood, and oak-hickory (Hamel et al. 1982). Prefers moist or bottomland woods rather than dry upland woods (Graber and Graber 1979, James and Neal 1986, Bohlen 1989). Also found in wooded residential areas with shrubs (Beissinger and Osborne 1982, Hamel et al. 1982, Brewer et al. 1991). On coastal Mississippi islands, inhabits slash pine (Pinus elliotti) stands with an undergrowth of palmetto (Serenoa) (Lowery 1940). On Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, inhabits dry scrub, cornfields, and forest edge. In Nicaragua, reported from arid thorn scrub and semideciduous broad-leafed forest (Mart\u00ednez-S\u00e1nchez 1989)(quoted directly from Haggerty and Morton 1995).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe Carolina wren is a resident from eastern Nebraska east to southern Ontario and New England, south through eastern Mexico to Nicaragua, and to Gulf Coast and southern Florida (NatureServe 2003). In the southwest region of the US, the Carolina Wren is a casual species in eastern Colorado and in eastern and central New Mexico (Haggerty and Morton 1995). In eastern Colorado this wren is a rare year round resident from the foothills east across the plains of Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992). There have been a total of 44 records of this species occurring in the state (Andrews and Righter 1992). In New Mexico, this bird is even rarer occurring as an accidental species primarily in north central to the eastern part of the state (BISON-M). Habitat in the southwest region includes lowland riparian forests, and urban areas (Andrews and Righter 1992). Generally, open deciduous woodland, mostly in undergrowth and thickets; parks; also shrubbery of residential areas provide habitat for this species (NatureServe 2003).  Habitat requirements include moderate to dense shrub or brushy cover (Haggerty and Morton 1995).  Prefers moist or bottomland woods rather than dry upland woods; also found in wooded residential areas with shrubs (Haggerty and Morton 1995). The data for the range in elevation is taken from the Colorado Wildlife Species Database (Schrupp and Cade 1989).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCARWx", "ELCode": "ABPBG06130", "scientific_name": "Thryothorus ludovicianus", "ITIS_TSN": "178581", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106550", "common_name": "Carolina Wren"}}
