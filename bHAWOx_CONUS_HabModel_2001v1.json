They are common in mature and mid-age upland and wetland forests, including managed pine forests, and they appear to prefer dense canopy forests (Layne et al. 1977, Ehrlich et al. 1988, Bushmann and Therres 1988).  They also occur in open areas with scattered trees, especially recently burned forests (Stevenson and Anderson 1994), as well as in small woodlots, wooded parks, cemeteries, shaded residential areas, and other urban areas with mature shade trees, although they are often scarce within these habitats (Hammel 1992, Kaufman 1996, Jackson et al. 2002).  Hairy Woodpeckers occupy deciduous and coniferous forests but regional patterns of forest type preferences may exist with a preference for open pine forests occurring in the Southeast, Southwest, and California (Jackson et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nHairy Woodpeckers forage on bark and green vegetation, sometimes by peeling bark (Kaufman 1996).  They mainly eat animal food-wood boring beetles, other insects, fruit and corn (DeGraaf et al. 1991).  They place nests 4-60 feet above ground in cavities that are excavated in dead wood (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Nicholson 1997).   Mature forests and burned forests presumably have more trees with heart rot and cavities for nesting so this species is often abundant in recently burned areas (Verner and Boss 1980).  Diseased trees (e.g., elms with Dutch elm disease) also provide nest sites (Kilham 1983), and they roost in holes in trees (Kilham 1983).  \r\n\r\nIn the eastern U.S., Hairy Woodpeckers are associated with extensive mature forests, mature wooded riparian habitats, and in wooded suburban areas (Jackson et al. 2002).  Little literature exists on the use of longleaf pine habitats, but Clifford and Conner (1997) found hairy woodpeckers to be virtually absent from longleaf pine in eastern TX.  They seem to avoid pine plantations in Ohio, Mississippi, and South Carolina but use mature pinelands and swamp forests in Florida (Jackson et al. 2002).  They are documented to be absent from North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands (Fussel and Lyons 1990), the Florida Keys and southern Florida (Robertson and Kushlan 1984).  Hairy woodpeckers use tropical hardwood hammocks and pine rocklands in southern Florida, but due to declines in these habitat types from agriculture they are rare in the everglades region of southern Florida.  They are also absent from North Carolina\u2019s barrier islands and the Florida Keys (Robertson and Kushlan 1984, Fussel and Lyons 1990)\r\n\r\nIn Texas, Hairy Woodpeckers occupy dense upland forests (preferably deciduous), lowlands, swamps, open woodlands, woodland and forest edges, and less frequently orchards or other cultivated areas (Jackson et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nHairy Woodpeckers are found in all forest types in British Columbia (Jackson et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nIn the southwestern U.S., Hairy Woodpeckers can be found in Douglas-fir forests, Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities, Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), pinyon-juniper woodlands, and riparian communities but they prefer deciduous trees over coniferous ones (Johnsgard 1979, Rosenstock 1998, Bent 1992).  In northern Arizona, Hairy Woodpeckers occur in coniferous woodlands, including pi\u00f1on (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus sp.), but it is a local resident in some Upper Sonoran deciduous woodlands and in riparian situations in the southern portion of the state.  They seem to require montane coniferous forests for nesting and move to lower, more mesic habitats with fledglings (Marshall 1957, Jackson et al. 2002).  New Mexico habitats include forested mountains in Sangre de Cristo Range, grazed and ungrazed rangeland consisting of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) (Goguen and Mathews 1998, Jackson et al. 2002).  In Colorado, they use lodgepole pine, spruce-fir, and aspen forests, and urban areas with tall trees (Kingery 1998).   Near Boulder, CO, they are found in douglas-fir-ponderosa pine and Engelmann-spruce-subalpine fir during the breeding season (Bent 1992).  In California, they are found in old-growth stands of conifers and oaks (mixed or open conifer), and also in successional habitats occurring after fires in the Sierra Nevadas (Jackson et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nThis species appears to be minimally impacted by forest fragmentation although declines with forest patch size likely occur due to a decline in nest cavity availability (Bushman and Therres 1988).  Need wooded patches of at least 2 ha, but 12 ha thought to be required to support a viable breeding population.  Minimum riparian forest width to support breeding was found to be 40 m in Iowa (Sousa 1987).\r\n\r\nFound from sea level to 2,600 m in Texas (Guadalupe Mountains), from 1,800 to 3,500 m in Sangre de Cristo Range in New Mexico, and up to 1,900 m in British Columbia (Jackson et al. 2002).
