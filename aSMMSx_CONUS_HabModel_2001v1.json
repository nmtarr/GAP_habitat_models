Many adults appear to remain within in 50-60m of their breeding ponds.  Forest management and stream modification are changing these habitats.  Occurs in the TN Valley and western third of the Coastal Plain.  Many of the populations may be disjunct.  Possibly occurs in the Ridge and Valley region.  In the western part of its range, A. texanum has been found in upland ponds, sluggish streams in tallgrass prairie, and oak-hickory-pine forest (Petranka 1998). Breeding habitats include semi-permanent wetlands, prairie potholes, forested wetlands, river bend oxbows, and stream pools. This species spends the majority of its time in burrows (e.g. crayfish burrows) on the floor of mesic forests adjacent to breeding wetlands (Trauth 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSMMSx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01130", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma texanum", "ITIS_TSN": "173605", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103285", "common_name": "Small-mouthed Salamander"}}
