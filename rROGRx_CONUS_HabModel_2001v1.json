The range includes central Oklahoma, north of the southern portions of the southern Great Lakes states, south into northeastern Mexico (Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas) (Walley and Plummer 2000).\r\n\r\nIn Texas, this species is found in wooded meadows, pastures, and suburban gardens. Encounters are common along ponds, streams, and swamps. The range of the rough green snake includes the easternmost area of the Trans-Pecos region and the barren southern plains. It uses canyons as corridors and favors tree species with prevalent horizontally oriented limbs over vertical limbs (Dixon and Werler 2000). Degenhardt et al. (1996) reported sightings of the rough green snake in the Cimarron River, Fort Bliss, and Old Fort Cobb, but disregard the species as part of the New Mexico herpetofauna.\r\n\r\nForested wetland, Riparian, Scrub-shrub wetland, Forest - Hardwood, Grassland/herbaceous, Old field, Shrubland/chaparral, Suburban/orchard, Woodland - Hardwood\r\n\r\nSE\t-dense vegetation (vines, shrubs, trees) near water; often at forest edges or in fairly open forests; also overgrown pasture, tallgrass prairie, thickets, barrier islands; open marsh and spoil banks in Louisiana; pine-oak, mesic hardwood hammocks, and occasionally mangrove swamps in Florida.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rROGRx", "ELCode": "ARADB23010", "scientific_name": "Opheodrys aestivus", "ITIS_TSN": "174172", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102569", "common_name": "Rough Greensnake"}}
