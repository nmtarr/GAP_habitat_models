PNV - Engelmann spruce - Alpine Forest, Douglas-fir - white fir, and Great Basin Desertscrub (Thompson et al. 1996).  It is found mainly in woodland or shrub habitat, but also in Rocky Mountain montane conifer forest, spruce-fir and pine-spruce-fir forests, tundra, shrub through old-growth mixed-conifer forest, and old growth temperate, high temperate, and coniferous wetland forests (Findley et al. 1975, Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996).  In the Jemez, San Juan, and Sangre de Cristo mountains, the species is mainly in spruce-fir forest (Thompson et al. 1996).  Suitable rock shelter is relatively more important than plant communities (Thompson et al. 1996).  The most important environmental factor is a suitable den location - vertical crevices in cliffs, large caves, rock and boulder outcrops, cliff dwellings, tundra talus, mine tunnels, and abandoned buildings (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996, Smith 1997). The species uses sagebrush and greasewood in its nests (Hall 1995).  N. cinerea eats blackberries, raspberries, gooseberries, red elderberry, trailing blackberry, Sambuchus berries, mountain lover, the fleshy part of cacti, bitterbrush, squaw current, goldenrod, fourwing saltbush, fringed sagewort, shadscale saltbush, prickly pear, Russian thistle, Nuttall's saltbush, bitter cherry, goosefoot, and mustards (Hall 1995, Smith 1997, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  In southeast Utah, many dens had a southern aspect (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The elevational range is 0-3600m (Smith 1997). It is found near sea level in Washington state.  Individuals have been captured from man-made buildings at ~4300m, but natural habitat may be too patchy for the species to occur at that altitude (Smith 1997).  N. cinerea occurs in northwestern Arizona (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986). It is present in the eastern two-thirds of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found in the Spring and Sheep mountains, and northern Nevada (Hall 1995). The species occurs in the San Juan Basin and the Jemez, San Juan, and Sangre de Cristo mountains (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). It occurs throughout most of Utah (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997). Occurs in the Santa Rita Mountains, Pinaleno Mountains, San Juan Mountains, Sangre de Cristos, Huachuca Mountains, Spring Mountains, Sheep Mountains, Chiricahuas, Jemez Mountains, Charleston Peak, Snake Mountains, Ruby Mountains, Pine Forest Range, Bull Run Mountains, Monitor Range, Toquima Range, Taos Mountains, Mount Grant, and the Patagonia Mountains. In California, occurs from the Oregon border in Siskiyou Co. south through the Trinity Mts. (central and eastern Trinity Co. to western Shasta and Tehama cos.), and from Modoc Co. south through the Sierra Nevada to southern Tulare Co. Optimal habitats are rock outcrops associated with coniferous forests, montane riparian, montane chaparral, and alpine dwarf-shrub. Common to abundant in valley-foothill hardwood, hardwood-conifer, and riparian habitats. Other preferred habitats include montane hardwood-conifer, Douglas-fir, redwood, red fir, Jeffrey pine, and subalpine conifer (quoted directly from Brylski et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990). Rock outcrops, mine tunnels, or other rock areas (e.g., talus slopes, lava rims) seem to be required (Escherich 1981).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBTWOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF08090", "scientific_name": "Neotoma cinerea", "ITIS_TSN": "180371", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101806", "common_name": "Bushy-tailed Woodrat"}}
