However, Sweet and Parker (1990) documented several introductions in the United States and Mexico; the common pine snake may also occur in Arkansas, New York, Maryland, and Veracruz. Franz (1992) and Tennant (1997) report this species as uncommon throughout its range; In Florida, it appears common in few small localities. \r\n\r\nThis snake is considered fossorial, arboreal, and terrestrial. Occupies habitat dominated by pine or pine-oak assemblages, and even xeric environments where it can be found in open, low understory. It prefers sandy soils thus the critical habitat are longleaf pine sandhills (Hammerson 2007). During cold weather, this species remains underground, but also during the hottest times of the day during the summer (Burger et al. 1988; Fitch 1956; Zappalorti et al. 1983). Franz (1992) described this species to preferably burrow in loose soil; Ernst and Barbour (1989);Zappalorti et al. (1983) have documented this snakes also  uses spaces below large rocks or decaying trees, also to occupy small mammal burrows, and that the female deposits its eggs in loose soil.\r\n\r\nCommon pine snake- lot of variation with common name", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rPINEx", "ELCode": "ARADB26010", "scientific_name": "Pituophis melanoleucus", "ITIS_TSN": "174263", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104367", "common_name": "Pinesnake"}}
