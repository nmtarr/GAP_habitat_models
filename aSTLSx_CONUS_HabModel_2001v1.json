During the breeding season, they are commonly found along the margins of small, rocky streams or seeps, but they spend most of the year under ground in forest floor habitats far from running water (Ashton 1988).  Coastal Plain populations typically inhabit bottomland forests.  Populations occur from near sea level to about 2000m in elevation. The Southern two-lined salamander is replaced by a congener, the Blue Ridge two-lined salamander, in the southern Appalachian Mountains (Petranka 1998).  They are sensitive to intensive timbering, land clearing, stream pollution, and stream siltation and are often absent from urban areas or highly disturbed landscapes (Petranka 1998).  Eggs are laid on the underside of submerged rocks, logs, or aquatic plants in the winter.  The female remains with the eggs until hatching.  The aquatic larvae remain in streams for at least 1 year (probably 2-3 years), while the adults migrate back to adjacent forests.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSTLSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05140", "scientific_name": "Eurycea cirrigera", "ITIS_TSN": "550246", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106084", "common_name": "Southern Two-lined Salamander"}}
