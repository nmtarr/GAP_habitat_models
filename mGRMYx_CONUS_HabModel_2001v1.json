They occur primarily in karst areas with underlying limestone caverns (Wilson and Ruff 1999) and choose warmer caves and mines usually located <2 km from rivers or other open bodies of water and rarely more than  4 km from water (Tuttle 1979, Decher & Choate 1995, ).  \r\n\r\nGray Myotis are cave dependent species, utilizing them year-round for roosting and maternity colonies (Tuttle 1979), and they are faithful to individual or clusters of caves (Trani et al. 2007).  During winter, Gray Bats congregate in a few large hibernacula, but in the summer they disperse to a larger number of caves where they form large sexually segregated groups (Sasse et al. 2007).  Movements of up to 775 km between summer and winter caves have been recorded (Trani et al. 2007).  Many roosts have presumably been flooded by the damning of rivers for reservoirs and human disturbance has driven many bats from historic roost sites (Tuttle 1979).  \r\n\r\nThis species forages primarily over open water in riparian areas and may use even the smallest of streams, but prefer broader stretches (LaVal et al. 1977).  They have large home ranges and forage over extensive areas (Sherman and Martin 2006).  In Missouri, members of one colony foraged at distancences over 20 km from the roost (USFWS 1979).  Observations of foraging Gray Bats have suggested that they remain within 5 m of the water\u2019s surface and low above the forest canopy adjacent to water (USFWS 2007).  Movements between roosts and foraging sites occur through forest and suitable foraging sites are adjacent to forests (USFWS 1979).\r\n\r\n N.
