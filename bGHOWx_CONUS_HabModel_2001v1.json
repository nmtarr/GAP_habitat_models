The species is non-migratory but does occasionally make irruptive movements that shift their distribution into the southern portion of their range during winter (Houston et al. 1998). \r\n\r\nGreat Horned Owls are associated with forest edges but hunt for prey from perches in open areas (Johnsgard 1988, Kaufman 1996).  Some common elements of Great Horned Owl habitat are relatively open hunting areas with some tall perches present, and sites for nesting and roosting (Johnsgard 1988).  They use a wide variety of habitat types including orchards, forests, deserts, grasslands, swamps, marshes, riparian areas, partially wooded slopes, agricultural areas, and woodlots in suburbs, parks, and cemeteries. (Karalus and Eckert 1987, Wolfe and de la Torre 1990, Houston et al. 1998).   They will use deciduous, mixed, and conifer forests but one study found the productivity of populations in contiguous forest areas to be lower than in forests fragmented with farmland (DeGraaf et al. 1991, Houston et al. 1998).  In south-central Pennsylvania, they were more strongly associated with cropland and pasture than deciduous forests and total forest cover, indicating a preference for fragmented landscapes (Houston et al. 1998).\r\n\r\nGreat Horned Owls are nocturnal hunters but will sometimes hunt during the day (Houston et al. 1998).  They hunt in woodland edges, agricultural areas, suburban areas, meadows, open and semi-open grasslands, and sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitats, interiors of open, mature forests, margins of wetlands, ponds, and lakes, and over open water (for waterfowl; Houston et al. 1998).  They roost in living and dead trees, thick brush, cavities, ledges, and human structures. They will roost \u201cdeep within canopy\u201d in places that provide cover, such as conifer trees or thickets within the canopies of deciduous forests (Houston et al. 1998).  \r\n\r\nGreat Horned Owls will establish nests in an extraordinary variety of locations: live or dead trees, cliffs, ledges, rocky crevices, bare crotches of trees, bare ground, nest boxes, barns, hollow logs, man-made nesting platforms, saguaro cacti, abandoned quarries, and caves (Karalus and Eckert 1987, Ehrlich et al. 1988, Houston et al. 1998, Wolfe and de la Torre 1990, NatureServe 2009).  Nests are frequently built in old usurped nests of hawks, squirrels, or crows, and there is even one report of a pair nesting in the side of an active Bald Eagle nest (Potter et al. 1980). \r\n\r\nThey generally nest in pine woods or mixed woods in uplands in the eastern U.S., feeding in open country, especially weedy fields and marsh, although they also forage within forests (Hamel 1992).  In Georgia and Alabama, they choose fragmented landscapes, including pastures, croplands and fields as well as forests, and they may be absent from heavily urban areas.  In Florida, pine flatwoods may be preferred, but they also use mixed hardwood swamps and \"other open wooded or forest edge areas\". They may require treeless brushlands in proximity of roost areas, especially those near lakes, rivers and marshes, in hammocks, and in heavily wooded residential areas (Layne et al. 1977).  In Jacksonville, Florida, they are mainly found along salt and brackish streams where they forage in woods, adjoining agricultural lands, pastures, prairies, shorelines, and parks (Stevenson and Anderson 1994).  They do not inhabit the Florida Keys (Robertson and Kushlan 1984).  In western and middle North Carolina, they have been found primarily in dry mature forests and edges and they prefer old-growth stands (Potter et al. 1980, Simpson 1992, Houston et al. 1998).  In Oregon, however, home ranges contained less than 70% old growth forest (Johnson 1993).  In the coastal plain of North Carolina, they are thought to be most common in edge areas between pine or mixed woods and marshes, fields, or clearings (Fussell 1994).\r\n\r\nIn the southwestern U.S., Great Horned Owls are found in many habitat types including wooded creek bottoms with cottonwood and willow, forests, grasslands, and deserts.  They are sometimes associated with white-tailed prairie dog colonies, with a dominant overstory of Artemisia spp (Clark et al. 1982).  In desert and badland areas without trees, Great Horned Owls nest on cliffs, ledges, rocky outcrops, and sheltered niches.  Otherwise, they prefer Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) for nesting but will also nest in Russian olive (Elaegnus angustifolia), Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) (Houston et al. 1998).  In Arizona, this species is common throughout the state in high-elevation forests, along cool riparian canyon streams, and in dry creosotebush flats of the desert lowlands (Glinski 1998).  They are found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona.  In central Colorado, they can be found in areas near cattle production that are comprised of shortgrass pasture and alfalfa with scattered stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and oak (Quercus spp.) in uplands and Plains Cottonwood (Populus sargentii) and willow (Salix spp.) in the drainages (Gatz 1986).\r\n\r\nWinter habitat associations are the same as summer ones (Houston et al. 1998).
