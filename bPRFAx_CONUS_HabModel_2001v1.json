It builds nests on cliffs, in trees, on power line structures, buildings, inside caves, on volcanic buttes, or stone quarries but its distribution is closely tied to cliffs (Steenhof 1998).  Habitats used in winter include desert grassland, creosote bush-bur sage, and agricultural areas (Steenhof 1998).\r\n\r\nIt nests mainly near cheatgrass and mixed shrubs in Utah, where it feeds on starlings and other birds in wheat fields, grassland flats, and large cattle feedlots (Steenhof 1998).  It prefers open habitats in west-central Arizona where it occurs mainly in desert grassland, chaparral, and creosote bush-bursage (Larrea tridentata - Ambrosia dumosa) habitats (Steenhof 1998).  Resident in New Mexico; can usually be seen throughout the state except in high forested mountains (Ligon 1961).  Common in the Pecos Valley (NM) and on the high plains eastward (Ligon 1961).  Will nest in protected crevices or recesses in high perpendicular canyon walls or mountain cliffs; usually adjacent to an open mesa or valley (Ligon 1961).  Can also be found in the upper drainages of the Pecos, the Canadian, the Rio Grande, and the Gila Rivers; also on and near the Continental Divide (Ligon 1961).  Is a resident in Colorado, more commonly seen in summer than in the winter; will nest up to 9,500 feet (Enderson 1964).  In Arizona, nests only in cliffs throughout the state; in winter, is commonly seem in open areas and agricultural areas (Monson and Phillips 1981).  Is a statewide resident in Nevada, and has breeding populations in every county (Alcorn 1988).  In southwestern New Mexico, can be found in plains grassland and Chihuahuan desertscrub (Eakle et al. 1996).  This falcon is primarily a bird of the plains and low foothills; in Colorado, this bird has been documented at 11,300 feet to 14,000 feet in alpine tundra (Andrews and Righter 1992).  This species nests in cliffs in northern Mexico and can also be found in the arid and semi-arid deserts and steppes of western North America (Lanning and Hitchcock 1991).  It is also known to breed less commonly in timbered mountains up to 3,700 m (Lanning and Hitchcock 1991).  In northern Mexico, the common habitat for this species is a combination of forest, woodland, and chaparral in the mountainous terrain surrounding the nest site, and with grassland and desert scrub on the open slopes and valleys in front of and below the nest site (Lanning and Hitchcock 1991).  This species is a statewide resident in Nevada; will nest anywhere with a cliff or a prey base (Alcorn 1988).  In the lower Colorado River Valley, this bird is an uncommon transient and winter visitor; these wintering birds are scattered through agricultural areas where doves and quail are abundant (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  This species will also breed occasionally in the valley in riparian floodplain and in cliffs (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In northern Colorado in winter this species winters in areas of dry-farmed winter wheat, and seemed to be dependent on horned lark (Eremophila alpestris) for food (Marti and Braun 1975).   In central Colorado, can be found in areas near cattle production, is comprised of shortgrass pasture and alfalfa with scattered stands of natural and planted tree groves; these stands include ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and oak (Quercus spp.) on the uplands and Plains Cottonwood (Populus sargentii) and willow (Salix spp.) in the drainages (Andrews and Righter 1992).  In east-central Colorado prairie falcons can be found in association with cultivated and fallow land because of the habitat use by horned larks, their primary prey (Gatz 1986). Occurs between 910 and 3,050 meters in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004). Glinski (1998) located an eyrie at about 10,500 feet in elevation in Arizona.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bPRFAx", "ELCode": "ABNKD06090", "scientific_name": "Falco mexicanus", "ITIS_TSN": "175603", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106120", "common_name": "Prairie Falcon"}}
