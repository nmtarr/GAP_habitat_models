Populations are also reported to occur into eastern Arizona and into Chihuahua Mexico. Other reported isolated populations occur in south Texas and extreme northeast Mexico as well. Known to hybridize with the Mexican spadefoot in part of its southernmost range (Degenhardt et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003). Isolated populations are known to occur also in northwest Arkansas and south central Colorado (Conant and Collins 1998). In Arizona, its distribution is in the northern part of the state where it is possible breeding occurs in the Spring while a distinct populated area in the south breeds in the summer (Brennan and Holycross 2009).\r\n\r\nIts preferred habitat includes hills, plains, valleys, and river bottoms sagebrush areas, desert grasslands, mixed-grass prairies, and even farmland east of the Rockies. Habitat is characterized by low rainfall with loose gravelly, or sandy soils (Brennan and Holycross 2009; Stebbins 2003). Known to avoid river bottoms and wooded areas and prefer open grasslands (Conant and Collins 1998). Also found in floodplains, prairies, and loess hills in the northeastern range, while occupying semidesert shrub, grasslands, sandhills, and desertscrub in the southwest (Lannoo 2005).Found in shortgrass prairies where the soil is loose and gravelly (Behler and King 1979). Breeding occurs in temporary pools such as playa lakes, farm fields, and even cattle tanks (Lannoo 2005). The juveniles burrow soon after metamorphosis in muddy banks along their natal ponds, or find cover in nearby leaf litter or cracks (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aPLSPx", "ELCode": "AAABF02010", "scientific_name": "Spea bombifrons", "ITIS_TSN": "206989", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100558", "common_name": "Plains Spadefoot"}}
