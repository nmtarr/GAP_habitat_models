Like other pine snakes, it is described as uncommon but might be due to the secretive nature of the snake (Palmer and Braswell 1995).\r\n\r\nThe main characteristic of this species\u2019 habitat is damp pine flatwoods, followed by longleaf pine and slash pine woodlands; habitat which is underfire control; also found along wooded edges of wet prairies, sandhills nearby water, between sandhills and bottomlands and pocosins, also in hardwood hammocks, and even in dry live-oak woodlands on the coastal islands of Florida and North Carolina (Dundee and Rossman 1989; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Mount 1975; Palmer and Braswell 1995; Tennant 1997). This fossorial and terrestrial snake hides from the cold of the winter and the heat of the summer in burrows, under loose bark, leaf litter, rotting logs, or other debris; buries in sandy soils, but also has been found in crayfish burrows, while eggs are preferably laid in rotting wood (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Martof et al. 1980 (as cited by IUCN); Palmer and Braswell 1995).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rPWLIx", "ELCode": "ARADB28010", "scientific_name": "Rhadinaea flavilata", "ITIS_TSN": "174265", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100676", "common_name": "Pine Woods Littersnake"}}
