In Mexico, it occurs in Baja California, Tamaulipas, and Chihuahua (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Frost 1983; Grismer 2002; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nIn general, the range of this species includes riparian zones, deserts, grassland, herbaceous areas, sand dunes, shrubland, chaparral, and conifer and hardwood woodlands. This is a species that burrows in or using loose soils, but also rocky to sandy soils. It can also burrow in fallen logs and leaf litter. Frequented areas can have vast or sparse vegetation. Preferred habitats include arid and semiarid areas such as desert flats, sand hummocks, rocky hillsides, river bottoms, prairies and desert lowlands. It is also found in pinyon-juniper and oak-pine zones (Degenhardt et al. 1996; Hammerson 1999; Stebbins 2003; Tennant 1984).\r\n\r\nSW\t-Fallen logs and leaf litter can be used as cover. Vegetation this species is associated with includes pinyon, juniper, oak, shrubs and grasses.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWGROx", "ELCode": "ARADB32010", "scientific_name": "Sonora semiannulata", "ITIS_TSN": "174275", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103641", "common_name": "Western Groundsnake"}}
