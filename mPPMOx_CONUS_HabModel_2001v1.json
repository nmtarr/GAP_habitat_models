It is found in ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper, broom snakeweed, rubber rabbitbrush, creosotebush, four-wing saltbush, big sagebrush, sand sagebrush, shinnery oak  scrub, greasewood, ephedra, yucca, skunkbrush, sunflowers, Stipa spp., bluestem, three-awn, blue grama, grama and buffalograss, wheatgrass, sacaton, dropseed, tobosa, galleta, ricegrass, cottonwood, sycamore, Apache plume and mesquite (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Frey and Yates 1996, Monk and Jones 1996, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  PNV-Grama \"short-grass\" and mixed \"short-grass\" (Thompson et al. 1996). In northwestern OK, it was found on rocky, brushy ravine slopes (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It eats the seeds of needlegrass, bind weed, sandbur grass, sedge (Cyperus), and beans (probably Astragulus), also the seeds of pigeon grass, and wild buckwheat (Davis and Schmidly 1997). The species eats lupine, scurfpea, milkvetch, and the seeds of Cryptantha, spiderwort, ricegrass, needlegrass, lupine, scurfpea, three-awn, puccoon, bind-weed, and milkvetch in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). In New Mexico it eats croton and ryegrass (Monk and Jones 1996). The mouse consumes free water in captivity, but extent of water use in the wild is unknown (Monk and Jones 1996). It is assumed to lick dew or eat green vegetation to obtain water (Monk and Jones 1996). Elevation is 305-2,043m (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The home range varies from 0.02-0.05 hectares with 47m as the longest movement within 24 hours (Monk and Jones 1996). P. flavescens is generally found on sandy or sandy-loam soils (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Monk and Jones 1996). Burrows are located under spanish bayonet or prickly pear (Davis and Schmidly 1997). Of three burrows excavated, two were 5cm deep and the other was 50cm deep (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). P. flavescens occurs in northeastern Arizona and Willcox playa in southeast Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). It is present in the eastern plains of Colorado, the San Luis Valley, and along the western border of the state (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs east of the Canadian and Pecos rivers in New Mexico (Frey 2004). The species is found in eastern Utah (Durrant 1952, Zeveloff 1988, Utah GAP 1997).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, the plains pocket mouse uses sandy soils with sparse vegetation. It creates burrows beneath clumps of Spanish bayonet and prickly pear throughout the sandhills region of the Panhandle (Schmidly 2004). In South Dakota at Lacreek National Wildlife Refuge, Wilhelm et al. (1981) found this species along the southern boundary of the refuge in the sand hills and also in transitional uplands among bare areas between vegetation. In Oklahoma, Blair (1939) found P. flavescens \"on rocky, brushy ravine slopes\".", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mPPMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFD01020", "scientific_name": "Perognathus flavescens", "ITIS_TSN": "180261", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104926", "common_name": "Plains Pocket Mouse"}}
