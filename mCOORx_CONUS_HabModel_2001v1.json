Apparently, riparian woodland and subtropical evergreen woodland near the resacas are avoided, or at least inhabited less commonly. Likewise, brushland habitats near resacas are not frequently used. They build their nests in cattails and small trees near or above water. Nests are constructed of leaves, twigs, small vines, and cattail, all finely shredded and woven into a globular shape. The resaca environment is declining in the southern part of Texas, largely because of drainage for irrigated agriculture\" (quoted directly from Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCOORx", "ELCode": "AMAFF01020", "scientific_name": "Oryzomys couesi", "ITIS_TSN": "180337", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104170", "common_name": "Coues' Oryzomys"}}
