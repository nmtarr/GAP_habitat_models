They can be found on wet rockfaces, in seepages, and among leaf litter and debris on the forest floor in and near streams (Petranka 1998).  Found from high peaks down to most mountain valleys within its range (King 1939).   At elevations below ~4500 ft and in winter they usually concentrate near seepage areas, springs, and small streams, but are more terrestrial at higher elevations and may range into adjacent wooded areas in wet weather.  The distribution of this species is restricted to a few mountain ranges in the southern Appalachians, including the Unaka, Black, Bald, and Blue Ridge mountains in North Carolina (Petranka 1998).  Their eggs are laid in wet rock crevices, under rocks, logs, and moss or leaves in seepage areas or near small streams.  The larvae are aquatic.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCMDSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03130", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus carolinensis", "ITIS_TSN": "550253", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105137", "common_name": "Carolina Mountain Dusky Salamander"}}
