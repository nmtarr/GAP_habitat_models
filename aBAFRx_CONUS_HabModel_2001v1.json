Known to use caves, fissures, crevices, and rodent burrows for hiding. Habitat is mainly limestone areas that often have creosote, hills covered with yucca, brushy woodland and even open forests. For example, in Texas, can be found in juniper and live oak associations; In Sonora, can be found in low-laying, large, dense clumps of cactus. No aquatic larval stage thus more prevalent in terrestrial environments (Stebbins 2003).\r\nIn Arizona, found in extreme south in the Santa Rita, Pajarito, and Huachuca Mountains; found in Evergreen Woodland in the Sky Island mountains. In New Mexico, can be found in the lower Pecos River drainage; also found in central Texas (escarpment of Edwards Plateau) from there its range expands into Mexico (Brennan and Holycross 2009; Stebbins 2003). Seen at night in large rock outcroppings (limestone, rhyolite, and granite), and near crevices on cliffs. Also found in mines, caves, wells, hiding in rock piles, and rock crevices (Brennan and Holycross 2009). The breeding habitat of this species is considered the rock outcroppings and crevices from which they call during rains, but some evidence indicates a movement of up to 50 meters from overwintering to breeding sites (Lannoo 2005).\r\nIn New Mexico, this species occupies creosote bush flats areas with nearby rodent burrows on gypsum substrates. In Texas, they utilize juniper-oak scrub forest. The Mexico localities vary from hills densely vegetated with yucca and other xeric environments to open pine forests (Degenhardt et al. 1996; Lannoo 2005).\r\nBehler and King (1979) describe Hylactophryne augusti to occupy damp limestone crevices and caves; especially during rains. The range is described to occupy areas from south east New Mexico and central Texas south into Tehuantepec, Mexico and then north into extreme southern Arizona.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBAFRx", "ELCode": "AAABD04170", "scientific_name": "Craugastor augusti", "ITIS_TSN": "773869", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102193", "common_name": "Barking Frog"}}
