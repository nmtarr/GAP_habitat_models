This species occupies boreal forest and tundra, brushy sub-alpine and alpine meadows, margins of shopping center parking lots and ferry terminals, open woodlands, burnt over areas in forests, brushy areas, willow thickets along streams or lakes, parks, cropland/hedgerow, old fields and orchards, shrubland/chaparral, and suburban areas (Chilton et al. 1995; NatureServe 2010).\r\n\r\nNecessary habitat features of breeding territories include grass, either pure or mixed with other plants; bare ground for foraging; dense shrubs or small conifers thick enough to provide a roost and conceal a nest; standing or running water on or near territory; and tall coniferous trees, generally on periphery of territory. The first 3 features seem characteristic of nesting habitat of all populations, and territories look similar throughout range, despite local variation. Site is most suitable if bare ground/grass and shrubs are distributed patchily (Chilton et al. 1995). The white-crowned sparrow nests on the ground under cover of shrubs and ground vegetation, or in shrub or tree up to a few feet from ground (NatureServe 2010).\r\n\r\nHuman activities such as road construction, logging and replanting, and farming often provide new habitat for all subspecies, by providing bare ground and grassland in previously wooded regions. Individuals breeding in riparian habitat in Colorado, however, appear intolerant of changes in vegetation structure resulting from summer cattle grazing (Chilton et al. 1995).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, year round residents occupy the same habitats as in summer; however, the migratory subspecies of white-crowned sparrow forage in flocks in grain fields, near roadsides, close to thickets/shrubbery for cover. This species seem less reliant on standing water than during the breeding season and roosts in trees or perennially-leafed shrubs at night (Chiton et al. 1995).\r\n\r\nB.
