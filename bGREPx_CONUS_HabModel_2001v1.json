The Green parakeet is native to areas of central and northern Mexico as well as Central America and its appearance in TX may be as escapees from captive birds or from natural range expansion (Howell and Webb 1995, Eubanks 1989, Forshaw 1973). Regardless of the cause of their change in distribution, they are now a resident species of extreme southern TX. Green Parakeets prefer nesting in cavities in dead Canary Island Palms, often utilizing former woodpecker cavities. Throughout its range in Mexico and Central America, the species uses open woodland, pine forest, humid forest, and farmland. In south Texas, the Green Parakeet prefers urban areas containing shade trees where they forage and palm trees which are used for roosting and nesting cavities. It sometimes nests colonially in crevices on cliffs (American Bird Conservancy 2013).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bGREPx", "ELCode": "ABNQA06010", "scientific_name": "Aratinga holochlora", "ITIS_TSN": "177683", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104474", "common_name": "Green Parakeet"}}
