Nesting colonies are often ephemeral due to the unstable nature of nest sites.  A variety of open and semi-open habitats surrounding nest colonies are used for foraging.  These habitats include wetlands, open water, lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, meadows, bogs, pastures, fields, grasslands, riparian woodlands, agricultural areas, shrublands, and occasionally upland woodlands.  They tend to avoid dense forests and woodlands, deserts, montane areas, and alpine areas, and usually feed within 200 m of breeding sites but this distance may vary depending upon the availability of foraging areas (Garrison 1999).  \r\n\r\nIn Utah, the species is a common summer resident in lowland areas (UDWR 2003). It breeds in open country near running water. It prefers grasslands and cultivated fields but uses a variety of open habitats, usually near water and suitable nest sites. In Colorado, it breeds in colonies locally in sandbars and occurs widely over riparian and agricultural areas in migration (Andrews and Righter 1992).  Does not occur at Lake Tahoe in Nevada; it is a lower elevation species (Ammon 2005). \r\nBank Swallows are generally found at low elevations.   Reported maximum elevations of breeding sites are 2,100 m in California and 900 m in British Columbia.  Most nesting colonies, however, are located in lowland alluvial valleys or at lakes, reservoirs, and coastal areas (Garrison 1999).  \r\nThis species is often associated with water but this relationship is likely based on water\u2019s role in creating suitable breeding sites.  The rivers where breeding occurs are typically low-gradient, meandering waterways (Garrison 1999).  N.
