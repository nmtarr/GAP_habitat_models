Its range also extends into Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, central and eastern Texas. In Mexico, this species occurs in northern Coahuila and eastern Chihuahua. Copperheads are found in deciduous forest, rock outcrops, floodplains and at the edges of swamps. In the arid southwest, this species is found near permanent streams. Rocks, logs, leaf litter, and stumps are a common surface cover where copperheads are found (Ernst 1992).\r\n\r\nSW-\tWoodland, desert, and riparian zones in southwestern texas.\r\n\r\nGP\t-Also in riparian zones of semi or permanent waterways.
