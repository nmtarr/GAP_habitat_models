They are most often encountered in muddy springs, sluggish floodplain streams, swampy wooded areas, and other damp, low-lying situations. They are also found in helocrene springs, seepages, small sand bottomed hammock streams (Carr 1940).  The semi-fossorial adults live in leaf accumulations in spring-fed brooks, beneath nearby logs and stones, and in damp rock crevices (Martof et al. 1980, Petranka 1998). They have been found in vertical burrows in damp, soft mud from 1 m to up to 15-20 m from water (Petranka 1998).  They are primarily found at elevations of less than 700m.   They are absent from most of the higher elevations in the Appalachian Mountains.  The mud salamander lays clutch of 65-200 eggs in late fall to early winter, apparently every other year.  The eggs are attached to objects in water or are laid in water-filled channels within the banks of streams and ponds (Green and Pauley 1987).  The larvae are aquatic and metamorphose in 14-32 months in western South Carolina.  They are sexually mature in 2.5 (males) or 4-5 (females) years (Conant 1975).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aMUSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD13010", "scientific_name": "Pseudotriton montanus", "ITIS_TSN": "173682", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106320", "common_name": "Mud Salamander"}}
