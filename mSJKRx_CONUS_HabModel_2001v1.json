This species has an altitudnal range of 50 to 800 meters (Grinnell 1933, Best 1991).\r\nThe subspecies D. n. nitratoides occupies valley saltbrush scrub and valley sink scrub communities on high salinity, alluvial fan, and floodplain soils ranging from fine sands to clay-sized particles (USFWS 1998). Typically, occupied habitats exist on level- to nearly-level terrain. Although Tipton kangaroo rats occur in terrace grasslands devoid of woody shrubs, sparse-to-moderate shrub cover is associated with populations of high density.\r\nThe Fresno kangaroo rat subspecies occupies habitat on elevated grassy patches on alkali plains or in grassy terrain with scattered alkali patches. Both habitat types are characterized by friable soils suitable for excavating burrow complexes (Culbertson 1946). They are typically associated with sandy and saline soils in chenopod scrub and annual grasslands, alkali sink communities and areas subject to seasonal inundation. Associated plant species include seepweed, iodine bush, saltbush, peppergrass, filaree, wild oats, and mouse-tail fescue (Culbertson 1946, Hoffmann 1974, Hoffmann and Chesemore 1982, USFWS 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSJKRx", "ELCode": "AMAFD03150", "scientific_name": "Dipodomys nitratoides", "ITIS_TSN": "180243", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100865", "common_name": "San Joaquin Kangaroo Rat"}}
