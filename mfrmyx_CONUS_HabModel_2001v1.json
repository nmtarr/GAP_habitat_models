It occurs in mature forest and woodland, mountain meadow, interior chaparral, scrub-grassland, grassland, desert and semi-desert scrub, swamp and riparian forests and scrub, and occasionally in tundra (Williams, 1968; Thompson et al., 1996; New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, 2000; Oliver, 2000; Altenbach et al., 2002; Keinath, 2004).\r\n\r\nThe species is most common in oak and pinyon woodland (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The species roosts in caves, mines, rock crevices, and snags (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It also roosts in buildings and bridges (Altenbach et al. 2002; Western Bat Working Group 1998).\r\n\r\nThis species requires water (California Department of Fish and Game 2003). The average distance from roost to nearest water for M. thysanodes is 1988 m, but individuals were captured over stock tanks averaging 3632 m from the roosts (Chung-MacCoubrey 2000). M. thysanodes uses reservoirs, wetlands, and springs (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It uses open habitats, early successional stages, and streams, lakes, and ponds when foraging (California Department of Fish and Game 2003).\r\n\r\nWhile an individual has been recorded at sea level in California, the species is rarely found below 200 m (Orr, 1956). The highest elevation at which the species has been recorded was 2934 m, in Colorado (Ellinwood, 1978).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mFRMYx", "ELCode": "AMACC01090", "scientific_name": "Myotis thysanodes", "ITIS_TSN": "180002", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100426", "common_name": "Fringed Myotis"}}
