(1991) are explicit regarding the range of G. breviceps vs. the range of G. attwateri noting that \"The Brazos River significantly affects the distribution of G. breviceps and maintains this species' allopatric distribution with G. attwateri located on the western side of the river.\" However, in Schmidly's (2004) second edition of The Mammals of Texas, range maps depict locations and polygon portions for each of these two species on either side of the river. He also includes the following remarks regarding their ranges: \"A small zone of contact between G. breviceps and G. attwateri occurs just west of the Brazos River in Burleson Coutny. Of 42 gophers collected in this area, 31% had an appraent karyotype intermediate between the two species, indicating that hybridization may occur in the wild. In general, the range of G. attwateri is limited on the north by the Brazos River, although small zones of contact with G. breviceps (the range of which is limited on the south by the Brazos River) may occur wher the Brazos River has periodically changed course in the past.\" I chose to include range portions on either side of the Brazos river per Schmidly's maps and considered that sampling along the entire potential contact zone along the river probably has not taken place (the text only referring to an area in Burleson County). Hence I was conservative in assuming the hybridization is occuring almost completely from north to south, leaving only a small area of non-overlapping HUCs in the south. M. Rubino, 15 August, 2013.\r\n\r\nAs with most Geomys species, the fossorial habits of G. breviceps dictates that the species prefers dry, sandy or silty loam soils >10 cm in topsoil depth and avoids moist and clay dominated soils  (Davis et al. 1938, Honeycutt and Schmidly 1979, Tucker and Schmidly 1981, Sulentich et al. 1991, Castleberry and Laerm in Trani et al. 2007, Schmidly 2004). Habitat preferences are essentially identical to those of G. bursarius (Schmidly 2004). The species is most common in tall grass vegetation, agricultural land, pastures, roadsides, and residential areas, and less so\r\nin open grassy areas within oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) and mixed pine-hardwood  cover types (Buechner 1942, Chase et al. 1982, Sulentich et al. 1991)(quoted directly from Castleberry and Laerm in Trani et al. 2007).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBPGOx", "ELCode": "AMAFC02060", "scientific_name": "Geomys breviceps", "ITIS_TSN": "552517", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105796", "common_name": "Baird's Pocket Gopher"}}
