This frog is highly terrestrial and commonly associated with sandy pine flatwoods and turkey oak-pine (longleaf) sandhills, usually in the vicinity of gum or cypress ponds (Wilson 1995). This species is also known to occur in mesic longleaf pine flatwoods, sand pine scrub, xeric oak hammocks, and rudereal successional stages of these habitats (NatureServe2005).  In general gopher frogs are very secretive in nature, taking cover by day in the burrows of gopher tortoises, crayfish, or small mammals, under logs, and in other hidden places that provide shelter (GA-GAP 2003). Breeding occurs in ephemeral to semi-permanent graminoid-dominated wetlands that lack large predatory fish (Palis & Fisher 1997). Egg masses are laid in water, typically attached to vertical stems of emergent herbaceous, reedy or woody vegetation and can contain up to 6000 eggs but on average masses probably contain approximately 1200-2500 eggs (NatureServe 2005).
