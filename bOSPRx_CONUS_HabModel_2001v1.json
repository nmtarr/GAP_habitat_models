The range of habitats where it occurs is so variable that it includes boreal forest, temperate coasts and lakes, subtropical coasts, and even desert salt-flat lagoons (Poole et al. 2002).  The presence of mature and decadent old growth ponderosa pine trees is important in some areas (Glinski 1998), and coniferous forests near rivers, lakes and reservoirs are often preferred habitat (Newton 1979).  \r\n\r\nOspreys typically build their nests on tall structures that are within a commutable distance (10-20 km) of shallow water (0.5 \u2013 2m deep) since they feed almost exclusively on fish (Newton 1979, Poole 1989, Ewins 1997).  They tend to choose stable nesting structures that provide maximum visibility from the nest, but they may place nests close to the ground when nesting on islands free of mammalian predators (Kale 1978).  Tall structures surrounded by water provide ideal nesting sites for inland-and coastal breeding birds.  A variety of natural and man-made structures are suitable; large snags, live trees (including pine, cypress, and swamp hardwoods), mangroves, buildings, utility poles, steel towers for transmission lines, windmills, rock pinnacles and cliffs, duck blinds, buoys and channel markers on pilings, fences, and artificial nesting platforms in water or marsh (Vana-Miller 1987, Poole 1989, DeGraaf et al. 1991). Man-made nests are so desirable to Ospreys in some areas that very few nests are placed on natural structures (Poole 2002).  Presence of at least one suitable perch in the vicinity of the nest is necessary (Ewins 1997).  Breeding birds often defend only the nest currently in use, the immediate surroundings, and accessory perches, and they exhibit strong nest site fidelity (Vana-Miller 1987, DeGraaf et al. 1991). \r\n\r\nThis bird\u2019s breeding range includes western Nevada, northern Utah, north-central and southwest Colorado, central and east-central Arizona, and west-central and north-central New Mexico (Kingery 1998, Poole et al. 2002). Its winter range includes Southwest Arizona (Poole et al. 2002).\r\n\r\nIt occurs from 244 to 2,530 meters in Arizona (Arizona Game and Fish Department 2002) and 854 and 3,050 meters in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004). \r\n\r\nThere is little data on the habitat associations of wintering Ospreys, but it is likely similar to those of summer.
