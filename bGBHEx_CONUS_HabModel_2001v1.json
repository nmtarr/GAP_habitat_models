Utah Conservation Data Center. http://dwrcdc.nr.utah.gov/ucdc/."}, "habitat_description": "The Great Blue Heron is a large heron that is widespread and remarkably adaptable.   It forages in slow moving or calm freshwater along lakes, rivers, bays, and lagoons throughout much of the country.  It also occasionally forages along seacoasts, in surf, mangroves, and in wet fields and meadows (Butler 1992).   It nests in single or multi-species colonies on islands, wooded swamps, upland hardwood forests, riparian woodlands, and lake and pond borders, within freshwater and marine environments.  Nests are placed in trees, shrubs, on the ground, and occasionally on artificial structures proximal to water (Butler 1992).  One study of distances between foraging and nesting sites found that mean distances were between 2.3 and 6.5 km (Butler 1992).  Nest sites are located in areas that are difficult for mammalian predators to reach, such as islands, trees in swamps, and high branches (Butler 1992).\r\n\r\nGreat Blue Herons avoid nesting in marine habitats in New Hampshire and New York; preferring inland sites instead.  Farther north and south along the Atlantic coast, they nest near fresh and salt water. The Occidentalis subspecies (Great White Heron) is restricted to coastal habitats of south FL (including the Keys) and is almost exclusively found in shallow water marine habitats, particularly tidal grass flats (Butler 1992).\r\n\r\nThe Great Blue Heron is the most often seen waterbird all over the Southwest (Davis 1997).  When possible, it chooses areas that are secluded and undisturbed, including marshes, wetlands, streams and lakes (Davis 1997).  It may also be seen in more congested areas, however, such as lakes on golf courses, ponds, or any water source where there is an abundant source of fish (Davis 1997).  At night, this heron prefers wetlands filled with tall trees (Davis 1997).  In winter, the Great Blue Heron is a resident of the lowlands, some remaining through the summer (Davis 1997). In Colorado the species is a fairly common to common spring and fall migrant and summer resident in western valleys, mountain parks and on eastern plains but is rare to uncommon during winter (Andrews and Righter 1992).  It migrates through Rocky Mountain Parks and is absent from high montane lakes (Johnsgard 1992).  Great Blue Herons are common summer residents over most of Nevada but uncommon in winter in northernmost Nevada (Alcorn 1988).   In Utah, they are the most commonly encountered heron; found state-wide along shorelines of lakes and rivers and in marshes (UDWR 2003).\r\n\r\nReported elevation limits for breeding are 1,100 m in British Columbia and 610 m in Vermont (Butler 1992).\r\n\r\nLittle information on winter habitat use is available, but they are known to favor natural wetlands and riverbanks over some other habitats such as farm ponds.  Along the Atlantic coast, they favor coastal marine habitats, especially salt marshes.  They occasionally forage in dry fields.  N.
