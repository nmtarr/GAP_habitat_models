This species has been reportedly introduced to Grand Cayman Island and Grand Bahama Island (Buckner and Franz 1994, as referenced by Natureserve.org). Perry et al. (2003) has suggested this species has been introduced to other areas of the Caribbean, such as on St. Thomas and the U. S. Virgin Islands.\r\n\r\nPreferred habitats include riparian zones, cropland, hedgerow, savanna, shrubland, chaparral, grassland, herbaceous, conifer woodland, and hardwood woodland. In particular, within its range, this species is found in pine woodlands, open hardwood forests, mangrove thickets, abandoned buildings, areas near springs, old trash dumps, near the entrance of caves, and brushy fields (Ernst and Ernst 2003). This fossorial snake is commonly found burrowing in or using soil, fallen logs, leaf litter, standing snag, and hollow trees. On Grand Cayman Island, this species has been associated with shrubbery and imported trees from Miami, Florida.\r\n\r\nSE\t-Pine woodlands, brushy fields, open hardwood forests, abandoned buildings, areas near springs, caves, old trash dumps, and mangrove thickets.
