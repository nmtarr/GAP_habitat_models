This species is known to burrow in or using soil, fallen logs, and leaf litter. Populations occur nearby permanent fresh water, along streams with rocky beds often associated with willows. Its habitat also includes mountain slopes and desert oases (Grismer 2002; Jennings and Hayes 1994; Rossman et al. 1996; Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nSW-Primarily associated with riparian vegetation (i.e. willows), uses leaf litter, fallen logs, and soft soils as cover.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rTSGAx", "ELCode": "ARADB36160", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis hammondii", "ITIS_TSN": "209149", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105900", "common_name": "Two-striped Gartersnake"}}
