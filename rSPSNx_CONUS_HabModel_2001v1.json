The elevational range of this species extends from sea level to approximately 2010 meters (Feldman and Hoyer 2010; Stebbins 2003; St. John 2002).\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits a wide variety of environments. From riparian situations to savanna and various woodland types. It occurs in bare rock, talus, scree, forest woodland, grassland, shrubland, chaparral, conifer woodland, and oak woodland (Natureserve.org). Stebbins (2003) has reported the habitats preferred by this snake include moist situations in pastures, meadows, oak woodlands, and along the edges of hardwood and coniferous forests.
