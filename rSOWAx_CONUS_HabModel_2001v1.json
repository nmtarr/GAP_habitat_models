Also shelters in bank-side burrows or remains hidden under vegetative litter. Burrowing occurs in or using soil, fallen logs, or leaf litter (Natureserve.org). Preferred habitat includes vegetated freshwater ponds, marshes, wet prairies, creeks, sluggish streams and rivers, temporary pools, swamps, and drainage ditches. It also ventures into salt water situations like meadows, marshes, and mangrove swamps. Riparian habitats consist of ephemeral pools away from permanent sources of water, bog, forested wetland, herbaceous wetland, and scrub-shrub wetland (Barbour 1971; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Johnson 2000; Tennant 1997; Trauth et al. 2004; Werler and Dixon 2000).\r\n\r\nSE-\tAssociated often with heavily vegetated riparian communities, but not with specific plant species.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSOWAx", "ELCode": "ARADB22030", "scientific_name": "Nerodia fasciata", "ITIS_TSN": "174248", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102514", "common_name": "Southern Watersnake"}}
