Utilizes estuaries, marshes, swamps, lakes, and streams; winter habitat is mainly in freshwater but also regularly in estuaries and sheltered bays. Nests are typically found in tree cavities in forested regions near water, often fast-flowing streams, also forest lakes and ponds, flooded forest, riverside swamps. Will use nest boxes as documented by Zicus (1990). Will utilize spruce/fir forests in Washington (Beall 1990).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nNevada: uncommon winter visitant with possible nesting in western Nevada (Alcorn, 1988). Colorado: rare spring/fall migrant and winter resident in western valleys, mountain parks, & on eastern plains (Andrews and Righter, 1992). May be uncommon or common very locally. Casual in mountains outside parks. Very rare nonbreeding summer visitor in western valleys, mountain, mountain parks and on eastern plains. Habitat: reservoirs, ponds, and rivers. Easily disturbed, tends to avoid areas of human activity. Nonbreeding in 5 states. Possibly breeding in mountain regions in western United States, as far south as New Mexico. In winter, generally restricted to areas where average minimum January temperatures doesn\u2019t drop much under -7 degrees C.  Migration habitat: open waters of rivers and lakes, brackish coastal bays, tidal creek, seasonally flooded forest, dead timber and shrub/scrub. Winter habitat: occupy shallow, freshwater, brackish bays, esturaries, and tidal creeks and ponds while they often concentrate along edge of ice. Generally found in river areas bounded by woods. New Mexico: migration and winter. Most common in middle and lower Rio Grande and lower Pecos valley. Occasionally in San Juan, Mibres, Gila valleys, Bitter Lake (BISON, 2000). In Arizona, occur on Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino & Kaibab National Forests. Rare transients at Mormon Lake.\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nHooded merganser's favorite winter habitats include forested freshwater wetlands, brackish estuaries, and tidal creeks. Occupy shallow, freshwater and brackish bays, estuaries, and tidal creeks and ponds, where they often concentrate along the edge of ice.  In Mississippi Alluvial Delta, they prefer deeper, more permanently flooded sloughs, backwaters, scrub/shrub, and overcup (Quercus spp), and oak/cypress/tupelo habitats (Fredrickson and Heitmeyer 1987). Habitat requirements in southern breeding areas are largely unquantified, although in Missouri nest boxes placed along slow moving, heavily forested rivers and lakes, and in dense buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis)/cypress (Taxodium distichum) swamps seem to be preferred (quoted directly from Dugger et al. 2009).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest/Great Plains:\r\nClosely tied to forested wetland systems throughout range, although nests in man-made boxes have been recorded in grassland areas in Minnesota (Zicus and Hennes 1988) and non-forested wetlands associated with riparian corridors (cottonwood/elder) in N. Dakota (Doty et al. 1984).\r\nIn Wisconsin (Kitchen and Hunt 1969), 75% of recorded broods occurred on a wide (20 m), shallow (33\u201366 cm), swift flowing (0.3 m/sec), forested river with 90% cobbled bottoms. Such habitat averaged 1.3 broods/km and contained the highest densities of fish and crayfish within the study area. Broods occurred on only 1 of 40 lakes sampled. Twenty-two of 30 observations of foraging broods were in waters over rocky substrate, which also supported the highest fish and invertebrate densities. Habitat requirements in southern breeding areas are largely unquantified, although in Missouri nest boxes placed along slow moving, heavily forested rivers and lakes, and in dense buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis)/cypress (Taxodium distichum) swamps seem to be preferred (quoted directly from Dugger et al. 2009).\r\n\r\nAll Regions Winter:\r\nAlong both coasts, Hooded Mergansers occupy shallow, freshwater and brackish bays, estuaries, and tidal creeks and ponds, where they often concentrate along the edge of ice (e.g., Veit and Petersen 1993, Sibley 1993). Elsewhere found in a wide range of freshwater habitats including emergent marsh, small ponds, rivers, and creeks (quoted directly from Dugger et al. 2009).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bHOMEx", "ELCode": "ABNJB20010", "scientific_name": "Lophodytes cucullatus", "ITIS_TSN": "175183", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104711", "common_name": "Hooded Merganser"}}
