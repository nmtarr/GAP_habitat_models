They are often under rocks in a few mm of water at margins of seeps, among gravel and cobble where ground water percolates to surface through muck, mossy rocks.  D. santeetlah is restricted to the Unicoi, Great Smoky, Great Balsam mountains of the southern Appalachians (Petranka 1998).  They lay clutches averaging 21 eggs, mostly in June. Eggs are laid mostly beneath mosses growing on rocks, on logs, or on soil surface. Nest sites 16-83 cm from nearest open water, commonly beneath mosses on logs lying in and around seepage areas (Jones 1986).  Hatching occurs in lab in 50-60 days.  Males sexually mature in about 2 years, females in about 3 years (Jones 1986).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSADSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD03110", "scientific_name": "Desmognathus santeetlah", "ITIS_TSN": "173643", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101251", "common_name": "Santeetlah Dusky Salamander"}}
