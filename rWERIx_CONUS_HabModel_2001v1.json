Prefers vegetation that borders streams, lakes, ponds, sloughs, and marshes. This species retreats to water as it swims and speeds away from danger while remaining among the plant growth near the shore. The Western ribbon snake is found in South Wisconsin to Gulf Coast and through North eastern Mexico to Costa Rica; from sea level up to 2440 m in the Sierra Madre Oriental, Mexico (Stebbins 2003). In arid regions of Colorado, this species is likely to be found nearby permanent water. In Oklahoma, it is found in brush proximate to ponds and pools to dive if threatened or disturbed (Hammerson 1999). This species lives along brushy or grassy margins of still water bodies. Found in water-filled vehicle tracks, swamps, marshes, rice fields, ponds, lakes, springs, streams, and rivers. Even A known invader of soggy woodlands, still not considered a forest dweller (Dixon and Werler 2000).In New Mexico, this species is found along the Canadian River at Mills Canyon and the Lower Pecos drainage near Artesia, Carlsbad, and Roswell. Its habitat is comprised of rivers, streams, irrigation canals, ditches, stock tanks, rocky and intermittent creeks in which deep pools remain in the arid southwest (Degenhardt et al. 1996)", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rWERIx", "ELCode": "ARADB36090", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis proximus", "ITIS_TSN": "174146", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104971", "common_name": "Western Ribbonsnake"}}
