Also north in the Mississippi Valley to extreme southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois (Barbour 1971; Conant and Collins 1991; Dundee and Rossman 1989; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Gibbons and Dorcas 2004; Johnson 2000; Phillips et al. 1999; Trauth et al. 2004; Werler and Dixon 2000). This species is known to burrow in or using soil, decaying logs, and leaf litter. In general, this species is seldom found far from water, it inhabits low gradient creeks and shallow water pools; also scrub-shrub wetland, forested wetland, and herbaceous wetland (Natureserve.org). \r\n\r\nHabitats include forested swamps, canals, irrigation ditches, shallow lakes and ponds, flooded fields, oxbows, abandoned rice fields, quiet waters of wooded areas, brackish marshes along the Gulf Coast, wet coastal prairie, and bayous (Dundee and Rossman 1989; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Trauth et al. 2004; Werler and Dixon 2000).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Basking and cover is provided by the dense vegetation found in riparian zones.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rMSWAx", "ELCode": "ARADB22010", "scientific_name": "Nerodia cyclopion", "ITIS_TSN": "174243", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105757", "common_name": "Mississippi Green Watersnake"}}
