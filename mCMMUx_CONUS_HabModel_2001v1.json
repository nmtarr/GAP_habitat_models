O. zibethicus occurs in pools, rivers, streams, reservoirs, wetlands, and springs (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It is found in ditches and marshes along the Gila, Pecos, Rio Grande, San Francisco, and San Juan Rivers (Thompson et al. 1996).  At higher elevations O. zibethicus is generally found in beaver ponds (Findley 1987).  In Arizona the species occurs in larger streams of central and western Arizona (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It occurs along all major waterways in the White Mountains, including the Gila River (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It occurs at Eustace, Black Rock, Nutria 2 and Nutria 4 on Zuni River, Zuni drainage, and Rio Nutria (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Frey 2005). The species is found on the edges of alpine tundra through all ecosystems in Colorado in riparian zones (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It uses irrigation ditches to move to more permanent water (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It needs a stable water source (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It occurs in riparian areas among aspen, cottonwood, willow, grama-buffalograss, grama-tobosa, pinyon-juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, gray oak, emory oak, little walnut, Engelmann's spruce, blue spruce, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, boxelder, Arizona sycamore, netleaf hackberry, western soapberry, white fir, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, bristle-cone pine, limber pine, border pinyon, alligator juniper, roseberry juniper,  mahogany scrub, scrub oak, shinnery oak, indigobush, sand sage, tarbush, ocotillo, greasewood, winter-fat, rabbitbrush, mesquite, iodineweed, fourwing saltbush, sedges, cattails, water horsetail, muhly, fescue, wheatgrass, sideoats grama, big bluestem, sand bluestem, galleta, ricegrass, alkali sacaton, black grama, tobosa, sycamore, and Apache plume (Willner et al. 1980, Frey and Yates 1996, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Frey 2005).  Found in cold temperate marshland, spruce-fir forest, juniper savannah, and agricultural lands (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).   O. zibethicus eats smartweed, pondweed, cordgrass, cattails, and burreed (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, NatureServe 2001).  The majority of locations for one study was within 15 m of the main dwelling, while most foraging took place within 5-10 m of the dwelling (Willner et al. 1980).  The home range is 61 m in diameter - 0.3 ha (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The temperature must be above freezing during a minimum portion of the year (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Humus is the preferred soil (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). Elevation is 37-3,354m (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). O. zibethicus is found in the larger streams of western and central Arizona and  in the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon (Hoffmeister 1986, National Park Service 2005). It is found throughout Colorado where permanent water and a food source are (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs in northern Nevada in permanent water and in the Colorado River (Hall 1995). O. zibethicus occurs in the drainages of the Pecos, Rio Grande, Gila, and San Francisco rivers, as well as the northern part of New Mexico (Anderson 1972, Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004).  The species is located throughout Utah in permanent water (Utah GAP 1997).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nMuskrats are abundant from the Chesapeake tidewaters of Virginia down to northeastern North Carolina (Webster et al. 1985). They are less common to rare in the mountains, piedmont and southern portions of the coastal plain (Lee et al. 1982). Most individuals in the mountains have been observed in valley areas at elevations below 2400ft (Linzey and Linzey 1971).  Muskrats prefer the tall vascular, non-woody plants of fresh or brackish water marshes for food and lodge building material (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Like beavers, muskrat lodges are built in shallow aquatic habitats. However, building material is predominantly of the reeds and sedges of the marsh. They are less abundant in wooded waterways, lakes, ponds and swamps, where they regularly burrow into waterside embankments rather than construct lodges (Webster et al. 1985).  Prefers fresh or brackish marshes, lakes, ponds, swamps, and other bodies of slow-moving water. Most abundant in areas with cattail. Rare or absent in large artificial impoundments where fluctuating water levels eliminate littoral zone plants (food supply) (Caire et al. 1989). Dens in bank burrow or conical house of vegetation in shallow vegetated water. Sometimes in uplands-Clough 1987. See Clark (1994) for information on habitat selection in experimental marshes undergoing succession in Manitoba.\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn California, this species is abundant in fresh emergent wetland habitat. Common to abundant in valley foothill and montane riparian habitats, aspen, and lacustrine, riverine, and estuarine habitats. Also occupies human-made habitats such as roadside and irrigation ditches (quoted directly from Brylski et al. [CA WHR 2008] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, muskrats inhabit shallow, freshwater marshes, creeks, rivers, lakes, drainage ditches and canals where cattail, bulrush and sedges are interspersed. Along the coast, brackish marshes of consistent 15-60cm depths composed of Scirpus species sedges provide optimal habitat. They use dome-shaped lodges constructed of marsh vegetation and extend 50-60cm above the water (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCMMUx", "ELCode": "AMAFF15010", "scientific_name": "Ondatra zibethicus", "ITIS_TSN": "180318", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103944", "common_name": "Common Muskrat"}}
