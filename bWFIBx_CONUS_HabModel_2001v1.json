The largest White-faced Ibis nesting colony in the world can be found in marshes around Great Salt Lake in Utah.  They are considered uncommon to common transients on lakes and ponds in the Southwestern lowlands. They are summer residents in the northern half of Nevada, and are recorded statewide in marshy valleys.  In Colorado, they occur in lowlands and mountain parks; mostly in spring.  They are fairly common to common spring migrants in San Luis Valley and on the eastern plains, but are to uncommon in western valleys and other mountain parks. They are very rare in mountains outside parks, and are rarely seen in western valleys, mountain parks and on eastern plains during fall migration.  The main breeding area is in San Luis Valley, where colonies occur at Russel Lakes, Saguacho CO., Monte Viste NWR, Rio Grande, CO., Alamosa NWR and San Luis Lakes, Alamosa CO. \r\n\r\nWhite-faced Ibises inhabit wet meadows; flooded hay fields; agricultural fields; freshwater wetlands of cattail (Typha spp.), giant burreed (Sparganium eurycarpum), and bulrush (Scirpus spp.); marsh edges; dredge spoil islands; mangrove swamps; flooded stands of saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and Baltic rush (Juncus balticus); and reservoir shorelines (Ryder and Manry 1994).  The Russel Lake State Wildlife Area supports one of the largest colonies in Colorado.  It is composed of lacustrine and palustrine wetlands with hydroperiods ranging from permanent to intermittently flooded.  Marshes of hardstem bulrush (Scirpus acutus), Olney\u2019s bulrush (S. olneyi), and alkali bulrush (S. paludosus) in the Great Basin host large breeding colonies.  Nesting habitats along the Gulf Coast include freshwater marshes of common reed (Phragmites communis), tatora bulrush (Scirpus californicus), bulltongue (Sagittaria angustifolia), saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), and torpedo panic-grass (Panicum repens) but bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) swamps are avoided.  They prefer freshwater but are also found in brackish and saltwater marshes and even in flooded fields.  \r\n\r\nFrequently used foraging habitats include shallowly flooded wetlands of short, emergent plants dominated by sedges (Carex spp.), spikerushes (Eleocharis spp.), salt-tolerant glassworts (Salicornia spp.), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), or greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus); and alfalfa, barley, and native hay meadows near wetlands (especially in Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Oregon; Ryder and Manry 1994).  Flooded agricultural fields are preferred over salt marsh for foraging habitat along the Gulf Coast (Ryder and Manry 1994).\r\n\r\nDuring winter and migration, breeding habitat is used as well as irrigated/flooded fields, mudflats, sewage aeration ponds, grasslands bordering playas, wooded streams, Nebraska sandhill ponds and marshes (Ryder and Manry 1994).  White-faced Ibises forage and roost in large flocks during the nonbreeding seasons.  Foraging and roosting sites can be far apart; one study documented a distance of 40-48 km between the two in Idaho (Ryder and Manry 1994).  N.
