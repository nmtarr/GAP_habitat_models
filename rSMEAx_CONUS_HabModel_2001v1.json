During the day, this species is most likely taking cover under rocks or logs. The habitat is mainly characterized by exposed rocky slopes in mixed deciduous pine associations; mesic hammocks, woodlands among floodplains, wooded areas that surround marshes, cropland, shrubland, vacant lots, old fields, and even in brushy or wooded residential areas and suburban orchard settings.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSMEAx", "ELCode": "ARADB39020", "scientific_name": "Virginia valeriae", "ITIS_TSN": "174151", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100943", "common_name": "Smooth Earthsnake"}}
