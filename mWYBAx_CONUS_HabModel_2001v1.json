This species may be expanding its range northward, due to the planting of ornamental palms (Snow 1997).  In Arizona, it is a year round resident occurring from Lake Havasu City southward and eastward to the Chiricahua Mountains (Snow 1997).  Upon publication of Snow (1997), this species was considered the rarest bat in the state with only 30 individuals collected.  Records for this species are primarily from Tucson and Phoenix (AGFD 2003).   It has also been collected in Yuma, Yuma Proving Ground, Sasabe, along the Bill Williams River and Chiricahua Mountains (AGFD 2003).  It has been confirmed in the Phoenix area (n = 10) and in Yuma (n = 1; Constantine 1966).  Although both males and females have been taken in Arizona, there have been no pregnant or lactating females reported from the state; however, there was one juvenile male was netted in 1994 (AGFD 2003).  Management areas where this species has been documented include the BLM lands managed by the Safford Field Office, DOD - Yuma Proving Ground, the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Havasu NWR and San Bernardino NWR, Coronado National Forest, Arizona State lands, the TNC Hassayampa River and Muleshoe Ranch Preserves and AMNH Southwestern Research Station (AGFD 2003).  In New Mexico, Guadalupe Canyon, Peloncillo Mountains, Hidalgo County, Mumford and Zimmerman (1963) captured 10 individuals, two of which were gravid females (total: 7 females, 3 males).  Druecker (1966) documented this species in Guadalupe Canyon (n = 1), south Hidalgo County.  This species was captured at Gibson Tank (1 pregnant female with two embryos), Double Adobe Creek (1 pregnant female with two embryos) and at a cement tank at Joyce Windmill, Lower Deer Creek (1 lactating female), Animas Mountains (Cook 1986).  Barbour and Davis (1969) portend a range expansion into cottonwood canyons of southern Nevada and southwestern Utah.  Mollhagen and Bogan (1997) surmise this species \u201coccurs only rarely in most of Utah, although there may be some predictable seasonal populations in Washington County during the summer months.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis species is known to occupy urban areas containing palm trees and low-to-mid elevation riparian areas containing broad-leaved deciduous trees including sycamores, hackberries and cottonwoods, which provide roost sites (AGFD 2003).  In the upper Moapa Valley, southern Nevada, L. xanthinus is clearly associated with exotic California fan palms (Washingtonia filifera; AGFD 2003).  Although this species is known to occur in developed areas, this species requires either palm trees or large diameter trees for roosting. \r\n\r\nIn Arizona, most of the records for this species were associated with palm trees and broad-leaf, riparian woodlands (Snow 1997).  This species is known to occupy urban areas containing palm trees and low-to-mid elevation riparian areas containing broad-leaved deciduous trees including sycamores, hackberries and cottonwoods, which provide roost sites (AGFD 2003).  It may also be associated with riparian areas containing Washington fan palm trees (AGFD 2003).  In the upper Moapa Valley, southern Nevada, L. xanthinus is clearly associated with exotic California fan palms (Washingtonia filifera; AGFD 2003).  Williams (2001) investigated four vegetation types (riparian marsh, mesquite bosque, California palm groves, and riparian shrubland) acoustically and detected L. xanthinus in exotic California palm groves 80% of the time (n = 2,972 minutes of activity).  L. xanthinus has also been documented roosting in the dead leaf skirts of palm trees (AGFD 2003).  Roost strata include Washington palm, hackberry, sycamore and cottonwood (Snow 1997).  Palm trees and broad-leaf, riparian woodland vegetation are most often used as roost sites (Snow 1997).  Individuals have been documented roosting about 15 feet above the ground in a hackberry (Celtis reticulata) and sycamores (Platanus wrightii; AGFD 2003).  The two roosts within sycamore trees were approximately 75 feet apart (Mumford and Zimmerman 1963).  \r\n\r\nHarvey et al. (1999) suggests this species tends to be associated with dry thorny vegetation.  Druecker (1966) documented this species in 33 sites within desert shrub-grassland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn southern Hidalgo County, New Mexico, Druecker (1966) documented this species in encinal woodlands (n = 1).  Three different vegetation types were surveyed during this study.  Sampling intensity per vegetation type did vary; 33 sites were in desert shrub-grassland, 19 in encinal and three in pine-oak woodland (Druecker 1966).  In the Animas Mountains, this species was either \u201ccollected or sighted\u201d in sycamore riparian and oak savanna, and has the \u201cpotential to occur\u201d cottonwood riparian and rabbit brush riparian (Cook 1986).  \r\n\r\nThis species roosts by day in leafy vegetation (Barbour and Davis 1969; Harvey et al. 1999).  It may roost in palm trees on the trunk or at the base of a frond during the day (from E.L. Cockrum pers comm 1992; AGFD 2003).  Snow (1997) suggests roost height is between 15 to 20 feet above the ground and within dense vegetation.  Yellow bats wrap themselves into their tail membrane for added thermal regulation while roosting, like their cousins, the red (L. blossevillii) and hoary bat (L. cinereus; Snow 1997).  In New Mexico, it was observed roosting on a hackberry branch over a road and within sycamore trees (Mumford and Zimmerman 1963).  The bat within the hackberry was approximately 15 feet above terra firma and well concealed (Mumford and Zimmerman 1963).  \r\n\r\nIn Arizona, the elevational range for this species is from 550 to 6000 feet (168 - 1830 m; AGFD 2003).  Snow (1997) provides an elevational range from 800 to 6000 feet.  In Cave Creek Canyon, Chiricahua Mountains, this species were observed between 5000 to 5800 feet elevation (Barbour and Davis 1969).  The majority of this species range occurs within Arizona.  Therefore, the statewide elevational information provided by AGFD is considered representative under EDR 5.  Elevational ranges provided by Snow (1997) and Barbour and Davis (1969) fall within the range provided by Game and Fish.  Thus, the information provided by Game and Fish is the accepted as the elevational range of 168 to 1830 meters. Because this species can occur in the lowest elevation riparian/ oases and desert vegetation types, this elevational range was changed to 0 to 1830 meters.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWYBAx", "ELCode": "AMACC05070", "scientific_name": "Lasiurus xanthinus", "ITIS_TSN": "552502", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103577", "common_name": "Western Yellow Bat"}}
