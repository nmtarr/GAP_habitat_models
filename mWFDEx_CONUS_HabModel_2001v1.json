In general they prefer deciduous forests, however upland mixed forests, hedgerows of ag areas, edges of clearcuts, riparian zones, and urban settings are also common habitats for this species.  It is less common at high elevations, in cool, moist coniferous forests (Wilson and Ruff 1999) and swamps. \r\n\r\nIn the Northeast, they are primarily associated with shrublands and woodlands.  They inhabit areas with hemlocks, white pines, and oaks and northern hardwood forests as well as woodland borders, ravines, stream margins, pastures with bushes and hedgerows, and farm buildings. They have been trapped up to 6,200 ft in elevation in rock and grass cover, and in grass-sphagnum stunted spruce habitat (Godin 1977).  \r\n\r\nIn Texas, they mainly inhabit woodlands, which are often associated with riparian areas.  However, in the east-central part of the state, they are most abundant in bottomlands with lower numbers in upland oak-dominated habitats.  On the Llano Estacado, they occupy various habitats including brushy, weedy fencerows, mesquite grasslands, and rocky juniper cover (Schmidly 2004).\r\n\r\nIn the West, the species occurs north and south of the Mogollons and in southeast Arizona (Hoffmeister1986); in southeast Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994); and throughout New Mexico except the northeast (Findley 1975, Frey 2004).  Suitable vegetative cover types include interior chaparral, grama \"short-grass\", scrub-grassland, shortgrass plains, oak savannah, warm temperature swamp and riparian forest, warm temperate swamp and riparian scrub, and especially sacaton grassland, aspen, pinyon-juniper,  post oak uplands, shinnery oak sand scrub, Toumey's oak, grama and buffalograss, wheatgrass, galleta, ricegrass, tobosa, winter-fat, tarbush, ocotillo, big bluestem, sand bluestem, cholla, huisache, tamarisk, sycamore, rabbitbrush riparian, cattail, creosotebush, cottonwood-willow, apache plume, saltbush, tall grass along creeks, and western live oak (Caire et al. 1989, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996, Davis and David 1997, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Thompson et al. 1996); brushy grassland or deciduous woodlands (Caire et al. 1989); ponderosa pine and mixed \"short-grass\" (Thompson et al. 1996).  It has been taken from ravine forest and near limestone rock, oak-hickory forest, oak-elm forest, post oak- blackjack woodlands, plume-sage sumac-grama, and rocky and bushy slopes with juniper (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). In Arizona the species is usually in thick grass or clumps of tamarisk; also in alder, black walnut, scrub oak, prickly pear, and mesquite (Hoffmeister 1986, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  In the Huachuca Mountains it was found in maple, walnut, Douglas-fir, and horsetail (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954). They were found in prickly pear, mesquite, and scrub oak between rocky ridges on a sand flat (Hoffmeister 1986).  The species is not found on desert pavement, tight clay soils, or in rocky areas in New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWFDEx", "ELCode": "AMAFF03070", "scientific_name": "Peromyscus leucopus", "ITIS_TSN": "180278", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103307", "common_name": "White-footed Deermouse"}}
