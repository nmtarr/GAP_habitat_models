It is associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) throughout much of its range (Rumble and Anderson 1996) and it historically occurred in ponderosa pine and Gambel oak forests in the Southwest (Vasquez 2005).  Roosting sites are important for Merriam\u2019s Turkeys during all seasons.  They predominantly roost in tall ponderosa pines but will also use Douglas-fir, limber pine, cottonwoods, and pinyon pine (Vasquez 2005).\r\n\r\nIn order to be suitable for breeding, habitat must include outcrops, logs, or shrubs that provide cover for nests and trees greater than 25 cm in DBH with large horizontal branches for roosting.  Nests are often located near Gambel oaks, especially within ponderosa pine-Gambel oak communities, and often in forested areas with >60% canopy cover (Vasquez 2005).  Broods forage in forest openings, riparian areas, springs, seeps, burned areas, aspen stands, flood plains, and forest-meadow edges.  Poults depend upon shrubs and other tall vegetation (>38cm) for cover within forest openings.  In meadows with shorter vegetation, they generally stay within 10m of the forest edge, shrub thickets, or small patches of trees.  The most productive brood habitat contains natural canopy openings with abundant herbaceous vegetation (Vasquez 2005).  \r\n\r\nIn mountainous areas such as the Southern Rockies, Merriam\u2019s Turkeys inhabit ponderosa pine zones as well as the pinyon-juniper habitats just below (adjacent and at a lower elevation) ponderosa pine communities.  Historically, their range included chaparral brush (Eaton 1992).   Reported elevation ranges are 1,067 to above 3,048 m in Arizona and (Shaw and Mollohan 1992, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2011) 2,300 to 2,960 m in New Mexico (Eaton 1992).  \r\n\r\nIn western Colorado, they occupy many mountainous areas vegetated with ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper, oakbrush, cottonwoods, mountain shrublands (primarily of Gambel oak), mixed conifers (Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, white fir, limber pine, Englemann spruce, and corkbark fir), aspen, douglas-fir, and forest-meadow edges within 10 m of one of these woodland types.  They are at the highest densities in pine-oak-grasslands (Shaw and Mollohan 1992, Vasquez 2005).  Large, pure stands of aspen are not used (Shaw and Mollohan 1992).  In the Black Hills of South Dakota, they use ponderosa pine forests and meadows and tend to nest on moderate slopes (Lehman et al. 2010).  They showed a preference for pine forests with trees >22.9 cm DBH and <70% canopy cover and avoided recently burned forests.  During spring in the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico, they use ponderosa pine, spruce-fir, aspen-fir, and oak communities (Shaw and Mollohan 1992).  In South-central New Mexico, they nest in mixed woodlands, blue spruce-bluegrass, and in areas that have recently burned (Eaton 1992).  They inhabit the ponderosa pine forests with gambel oak (Quercus gambelli) and New Mexican locust (Robinia neomexicana) of Grand Canyon\u2019s Parashant National Monument in the Uinkaret Mountains of northwestern Arizona (Martin et al. 2005).  In Montana, Merriam\u2019s Turkeys utilize ponderosa pine woodlands and have been most successful where pines make up half of the total cover and the other half is vegetated with grasses, deciduous trees, and shrubs in scattered openings and drainages (Montana State University Extension 2011).  They also use grasslands in the southeastern portion of Montana. \r\n\r\nIn addition to mountainous areas, Merriam\u2019s Turkeys occur at lower elevations in riparian deciduous habitats extending into desert, sagebrush, and prairies of states that neighbor the Rocky Mountains (Shaw and Mollohan 1992, National Wild Turkey Foundation 2011).  In Nebraska, Merriam\u2019s Turkeys can be found in riparian and isolated woodlands, shelterbelts, and along wooded streams (Nebraska Game and Parks Commission 2011).  \r\n\r\nThe winter distribution of Merriam\u2019s Turkeys is strongly influenced by food availability, and they select areas with a more open understory, higher basal area, and higher overstory canopy cover than those selected during Summer (Lehman et al. 2010). \r\n\r\nMerriam\u2019s Turkeys make altitudinal migrations in the Southern Rockies to ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper, Gambel oak, and cottonwood riparian habitats when snow accumulates at higher elevations (Vasquez 2005, Lehman et al. 2007).  Ponderosa pine-gambel oak communities provide foraging habitat during winter (Vasquez 2005), but turkeys will also forage on waste grains in agricultural fields (Lehman et al. 2007).  Turkeys roost and forage in dense stands of ponderosa pine or pinyon-juniper and Douglas fir forests are also used (Vasquez 2005).   Winter habitats in the Black Hills, South Dakota include farmsteads, ponderosa pine woodlands, and forests with <70% canopy cover and trees >22.9 DBH (Lehman et al. 2010).  In Montana, turkeys move into lower drainages vegetated with deciduous trees and shrubs (Montana State University Extension 2011).  Great Basin conifer woodlands of pinyon-juniper with Colorado pinyon pine and a variety of juniper species are used during winter (Shaw and Mollohan 1992).\r\n\r\nVasquez (2005) reported a winter elevation limit in Colorado of 3,048 m.  \r\n\r\nN.
