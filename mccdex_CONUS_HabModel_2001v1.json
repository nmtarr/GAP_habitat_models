The University of Arizona Press and the Arizona Game and Fish Department, Tucson, Arizona. 602 pages."}, "habitat_description": "The Cactus Deermouse (Peromyscus eremicus) lives in desert portions of the Southwest.  In California, it is found up to 1200 m and is common in desert riparian, desert scrub, desert wash, Joshua tree dominated, pinyon-juniper dominated, and palm oasis areas.  It is also present but less common in coastal scrub, chamis-redshank and mixed chaparral, and sagebrush (Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nElsewhere in its range, this species can be found in a variety of arid vegetative communities both near and away from water.  During a study in the lower reach of Colorado River, this species demonstrated a continuous presence in flooded areas (Andersen and Nelson 1999).  However, in the Chiricahua Mountains, water was entirely absent from observed localities (Cahalane 1939). \r\n\r\nThis species commonly inhabitats desertscrub.  It is identified as \u201cmost typical\u201d and \u201cwidespread desert dwelling member of the genus\u201d (Baker 1968).  In southern Arizona, Dice and Blossom (1937) trapped this species in saguaro, ocotillo and palo verde desert, modified mesquite forest, ocotillo-dominated desert, sandy wash adjacent to oak, mesquite and sumac, and palo verde-mesquite-grass association.  Hoffmeister (1986) suggests this species occurs in Mohave desertscrub, desert grassland.  Near the Fort on the Huachuca Mountains, the mice occurred within mesquite, white thorn and yucca (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954).  In the Chiricahua Mountains, it was abundant in the Lower Sonoran Zone along the eastern slopes (Cahalane 1939).  In the Sonoita Valley, Santa Cruz County, this species was trapped in grazed shrubland characterized by scattered mesquite (Prosopis velutina), and a variety of emergent succulents including Agave palmeri, Yucca elata and Dasylirion wheeleri  (Jones et al. 2003).  In the Pinalenos Mountains, this mouse was trapped on the alluvial flats and fans below the wooded areas within desertscrub (Hoffmeister 1956).  In the Sonoran Desert, 30 miles NW of Tucson, this species was found within (1) creosote bush community characterized by Larrea divaricata, various cacti, and annuals, and (2) palo verde-saguaro community located within the rocky hills and characterized by Cercidium microphyllum, Carnegia giganteus, cholla (Opuntia spp.), ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), brittlebush (Encelia farinosa) and white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa; n = 217; Reichman and van de Graaff 1973).  On the Verde and Salt River, approximately 25 miles northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, this species was trapped throughout the 13-month trapping period (270 trap nights), it was captured at the lowest densities during the study within desert shrub (2.1 captures/ 270 trap nights); desertscrub vegetation was dominated by palo verde-saguaro with minor areas of creosote (Stamp and Ohmart 1976).  This mouse is identified as occurring within desert (Baker 1968).  In the Grand Canyon, this mouse occurred within both a typical desert vegetation, which is uninfluenced by the river regime and is characterized by brittlebush (Encelia farinosa), cacti (Opuntia spp.), creosote (Larrea tridentata) and Mormon tea (Ephedra spp.; Ruffner et al. 1978).  In New Mexico, it occurs within mesquite-grass, malpais lava and desert mountain range associations (Findley et al. 1975; Veal and Caire 1979).  On the Animas Mountains, New Mexico, this species is usually found in the Chihuahuan Desert in association with Schott\u2019s agave, ocotillo and turpentine bush (Cook 1986).  On plains and bajadas, it occurs where mesquite grows on aeolian sands (Findley et al. 1975).  On the Florida Mountains, it was observed on south facing slopes within barrel cactus, Yucca baccata and Mimosa (Findley et al. 1975).  In Las Cruces, Hallett (1982) sampled rodents along a bajada slope characterized by creosote bush, mesquite, tarbush (Flourensia cernua), Apache plume, soaptree yucca (Yucca elata) and banana yucca (Yucca baccata; n = 49 individuals).  In the Alamo Hueco, Big Hatchet and Sierra Rica Mountains, Hidalgo County, this species is known to occur along rock hillsides in the mesquite-Larrea areas (Hayward et al. 1978).  In Nevada, this species is typically associated with the Lower Sonoran Life-Zone (Hall 1946), occurring within creosote and desert shrub associations of the southern portion of the state (Veal and Caire 1979).  West of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, this mouse was trapped in creosote desert characterized by Ichaenactis, Chorizanthe, Cryptantha, Phacelia, Eriogonum, Hilaria rigida, Oryzopsis hymenoides and Bromus rubens (n = 9; Bradley and Mauer 1973).  The desertshrub systems fit the information listed above.  Also, these ecological systems are either known to and/ or most likely occur within the known range of this species.  Therefore, inclusion of this system is justified.  This species is expected to occur year round where suitable habitat is present.  Joshua tree woodlands:  On the Arizona Strip, north of Grand Canyon, this species was observed within creosote-saltbrush and Joshua tree forest (Hoffemister and Durham 1971).  \r\n\r\nSeveral grassland types are suitable for this species.  In the Sonoita Valley, Santa Cruz County, this species was trapped in ungrazed warm-season perennial bunchgrasses characterized by Aristida, Bouteloua, Eragrostis, Heteropogon, Hilaria and Lycurus (Jones et al. 2003).  In the Pinalenos Mountains, this mouse was trapped on the alluvial flats and fans below the wooded areas within grasslands (Hoffmeister 1956).  This mouse is identified as occurring within grasslands (Baker 1968).  The grassland systems fit the information listed above.  Also, these ecological systems are either known to and/ or most likely occur within the known range of this species.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in high desert.  On the Tonto Plateau, Grand Canyon, this species inhabits blackbrush-greasebush-prickly pear association (Hoffmeister 1971).  In Utah, it has been identified as occurring within the Lower Sonoran Zone (Long 1940), within riparian (Hardy 1945), blackbrush and atriplex associations (Hardy 1945).  In the Saint George Basin, it was trapped within think stands of arrowweed (Pluchea sericea) with rabbit-brush (Chrysothamnus graveolens) and quailbush (Atriplex lentiformis) and within blackbrush association characterized by blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima), matchweed (Gutierrezia lucida), Hymenoclea salsola, Bromus rubens, Astragalus trichocarpus and Erodium cicutarium (Hardy 1945).  Atriplex-Hilaria was characterized by four-winged saltbrush (Atriplex canescens), clumps of grass (Hilaria rigida), Lycium andersonii, winter fat (Eurotia lanata) and cholla (Opuntia echinocarpa; Hardy 1945).  In the Virgin River Province, southwestern most portion of the state, Honeycutt et al. (1981) identified this species within blackbrush and creosote bush communities.  Blackbrush was characterized by Coleogyne ramosissima, Lycium andersonii and Bromus rubens and creosote bush community was represented by Larrea tridentata, Franseria dumosa, Bromus rubens, Yucca brevifolia, Yucca spp., and Opuntia spp. (Honeycutt et al. 1981).  Historically, this mouse is restricted to the southwestern portion of the Washington County and mostly within the Lower Sonoran Life-Zone, specifically \u201cmore or less restricted to the cactus vegetation\u201d (n = 16; Durrant 1952).   \r\n\r\nCactus Deermice inhabit chaparral, encinal woodlands, and pinyon-juniper woodlands.  Hoffmeister (1986) suggests this species occurs less frequently in chaparral and Mexican oak woodland.  This mouse is identified as occurring within pinyon-juniper-oak woodlands (Baker 1968).  At Montezuma Castle NM, near Wet Beaver Creek, this species was trapped along the upper terrace characterized by Juniperus monosperma, Prosopis velutina, Acacia greggii, Gutierrezia sarothrae, Atriplex canescens, Marrubium vulgare and Berberis haematocarpa and three species of perennial grasses, several species of annual grasses, two species of herbs and 12 shrub species (n = 31; Ellison and van Riper 1998).  In the Spring Mountains, Clark County, Nevada, it was trapped in pinyon-juniper country (Deacon et al. 1964).  Historically in southern Nevada, this species was found along the lower part of the pinyon/ pine-juniper belt (Burt 1936).  \r\n\r\nMesquite and tamarisk bosque are also inhabited.  In southern Arizona, Dice and Blossom (1937) trapped this species in mesquite thickets.  On the Verde and Salt River, approximately 25 miles northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, this species was trapped throughout the 13-month trapping period (270 trap nights), it was captured within mesquite (3.5 captures/ 270 trap nights); these mesquite stands were situated upon terraces and high floodplains (Stamp and Ohmart 1979).  In the Lower Colorado River Valley, this species was captured within  honey mesquite, and salt cedar-honey mesquite communities from 1974 through 1974 (four-year study; Anderson and Ohmart 1977).   In the Grand Canyon, this mouse was observed within an area delineated by the high water line characterized by Apache plume (Celtis reticulata), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and acacia (Acacia greggii; Ruffner et al. 1978).  In Arizona, it occurs in \u201crock hill, Tamarisk, and desert plain associations (Cahalane 1939; Veal and Caire 1979).  On the Verde and Salt River, approximately 25 miles northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, this species was trapped throughout the 13-month trapping period (270 trap nights), it was captured with the highest densities, in tamarix (12.8 captures/ 270 trap nights; no grids were trapped during March, May and July 1975); tamarisk occurred along the low floodplains and sandbars (Stamp and Ohmart 1979).  In the Lower Colorado River Valley, this species was captured within salt cedar and salt cedar-honey mesquite communities (Anderson and Ohmart 1977).  The presence of \u201cmonotypic stands of saltcedar are replacing both First and Second Bottom plant communities\u201d in the lower reach of the Colorado River, and appear to offer suitable macrohabitat for this species (Andersen and Nelson 1999).  In the Grand Canyon, this mouse was occurred within a flood zone characterized by seep willow (Baccharis spp.), willows (Salix spp., S. exigua), tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea; Ruffner et al. 1978).  \r\n\r\nRiparian vegetative cover can be suitable for the species.  In southern Arizona, Dice and Blossom (1937) trapped this species in cottonwood-willow association and sycamore associations.  At Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, this species is \u201cmost common\u201d within riparian situations and in areas of rocky slopes and bluffs covered (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1986) with dense vegetation (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1986; Petryszyn and Cockrum 1990).  On the Verde and Salt River, approximately 25 miles northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, this species was trapped throughout the 13-month trapping period (270 trap nights), it was captured within cottonwood (6.9 captures/ 270 trap nights); these cottonwood stands occurred along the river corridor and paralleled the rivers (Stamp and Ohmart 1979).  At Montezuma Castle NM, near Wet Beaver Creek, this species was trapped along the lower terrace, which was characterized by Platanus wrightii, J. monosperma, P. velutina, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Juglans major, Chilopsis linearis, G. sarothrae, A. greggii, B. haematocarpa, Brickellia californica with four species of perennial grasses, several species of annual grasses, six species of forbs and nine species of shrub (n =36; Ellison and van Riper 1998).  In the Lower Colorado River Valley, this species was captured within cottonwood-willow (Anderson and Ohmart 1977).   In the Lower Colorado River Valley, this species occurred most frequently in cottonwood/ willow and secondly in \u201cdense thickets\u201d at No Name Lake (0.359 capture per unit effort; 828 total captures; Andersen and Nelson 1999).  In the Grand Canyon, this mouse was occurred within a flood zone characterized by seep willow (Baccharis spp.), willows (Salix spp., S. exigua), tamarisk (Tamarix spp.), and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea; Ruffner et al. 1978).  \r\n\r\nFreshwater marsh is also suitable habitat.  At Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, where two springs were small mammals were trapped \u2013 vegetation at Quitobaquito Spring consists of rush (Scirpus sp., Eleocharis sp., Juncus sp.), cattail (Typha sp.), cottonwood (Populus sp.), salt grass (Distichlis sp.), salt bush (Atriplex sp.), mesquite (Prosopis sp.) and seep willow (Baccharis sp.; N = 37); no vegetation description was provided for Williams Spring (N = 18; Petryszyn and Cockrum 1990).  \r\n\r\nAt Fort Lowell, this species was trapped along brush fences (n =1; Allen 1895).  At Fairbank along the San Pedro River, this species was trapped in open fields (n =2; Allen 1895).  \r\n  \r\nHistorically, it was found \u201csparingly\u201d and \u201ctrapped by brush fenses at Fort Lowell and in open fields at Fairbank (Allen 1895).  At the confluence of the Verde and Salt Rivers, this species was associated with shrubby vegetation with high trap numbers within highest perennial cover (Stamp and Ohmart 1979).  Denning ecology \u2013  In Grand Canyon, this mouse dens within rock crevices, abandoned burrows, piles of debris and clumps of yucca and cacti (Hoffmeister 1971).\r\n\r\nWithin suitable cover types, the species may be found among cacti, creosote bush, and woodpiles (Hoffmeister 1986).   It may also live in the abandoned burrows created by other mammals, or within some parts of wood rat middens (Hoffmeister 1986).  Using regression analyses, Hallett (1982) found this species was negatively influenced by the presence of Flourensia cernua and Yucca spp. along a creosote bush bajada near Las Cruces, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom two site localities in Cochise County, this species occurs at 35, 1200, and 1363 meters (Cockrum 1960).  Historically in southern Nevada, this species has been collected in Kyle Canyon at 4500 feet, Willow Creek at 6000 feet, Pahrump Ranch at 2667 feet, Muddy Creek at 1250 feet and Indian Springs 3280 feet; the range is from 1250 to 6000 feet elevation (Burt 1936).  West of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada, this mouse was trapped at around 2500 feet (n = 9; Bradley and Mauer 1973).  In the Spring Mountains, Clark County, it was trapped in around 6600 feet (~2000 meters) elevation within pinyon-juniper country (Deacon et al. 1964).  In Las Cruces, New Mexico, Hallett (1982) trapped this species at 1375 meters elevation (n = 49).  In Utah, elevations for observations of this mouse within Washington County is 3200 feet (n = 5), 2880 feet (n = 4), 2800 feet (n = 2), and 2600 feet (n = 5; Durrant 1952).  The available information seems to satisfy EDR 5.  Consequently, the available information was combined and an elevational range was derived.  The estimated elevational range for this species\u2019 range is from 35 to 2000 meters.  \r\n\r\nHoffmeister (1986) and Dice and Blossom (1937) identify rocks, rocky slopes, rock ledges, canyon bottoms, and sandy flats as important strata.  In the Chiricahua Mountains, Cahalane (1939) identified this mouse in areas where there was little soil and suggested it dens within rock crevices; however, in other areas, such as the plains, it excavated groupings of burrows within mesquite shrubland.  In the Lower Colorado River Valley, this mouse was found on arenaceous alluvium and along desert washes leading down from the desert interior, as well as on aeolian accumulations of fine sand; both of which are described as fine but loose in consistency and friable (Grinnell 1914).  In New Mexico, it \u201cprefers\u201d on rocky foothills of desert mountain ranges and hills and sometimes occurs on bajadas and plains (Findley et al. 1975).  This species inhabits rock, xeric hillsides on the Animas Mountains (Cook 1986).  In St. George, Utah, it was abundant in rich loamy soils of river bottoms, but was not taken from rocky substrates (Long 1940).  Because this information suggests this species is equally apt for occurring in both rocky and sandy substrates, this information will not be included.  This information suggests this species can occur in both the most rocky and granularly finest types of soils that exist.  Thus, perhaps this species is a generalist in this respect.  It both burrows and takes advantage of rocky crevices.   \r\n\r\nIn the Huachuca Mountains, this species was observed at the mouth of Carr Canyon, specimens (n = 2) were collected along the canyon edge and partially up the alluvial fan; dry, rocky hills, covered with Agave arose sharply from the fan adjacent to where the mice were captured (Hoffmeister and Goodpaster 1954).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCCDEx", "ELCode": "AMAFF03010", "scientific_name": "Peromyscus eremicus", "ITIS_TSN": "180286", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100994", "common_name": "Cactus Deermouse"}}
