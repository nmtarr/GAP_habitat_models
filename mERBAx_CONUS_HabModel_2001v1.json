It is also present in eastern Colorado and southeastern New Mexico (Hall 1981, Bat Conservation International 2002), along the Rio Grande north through the Bosque Del Apache (Bogan and Chung-MacCoubrey 2005), in Eddy County at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, and in Portales on the Llano Estacado in Roosevelt County (Frey 2004). The species occurs in New Mexico in Socorro County along the Rio Grande (Valdez et al. 1999, Frey 2004). \r\n\r\nLasiurus borealis is a tree-roosting bat, which finds shelter among the foliage of trees and shrubs (Webster et al. 1985, Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  It roosts in the foliage of deciduous and sometimes evergreen trees (Bat Conservation International 2002).  It is rarely found in caves, manmade structures, or mines (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Foliage of mid to lower branches is used most frequently in thickets of woods near more open habitats or water bodies.  Spanish moss is used frequently in southern portions of its range. \r\n\r\nEastern Red Bats are typically solitary when roosting (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Young are raised from the same roosting situations as adults (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  However, maternity roosts are typically slightly higher in the tree (Webster et al. 1985). \r\n\r\nEastern Red Bats are typically found in edge situations, along wide fencerows, forested edges of crop fields, woodlots, stream banks, residential areas, parks, orchards, and cemetaries (FL-GAP 2001).  During the day, they commonly roost in edge habitats adjacent to streams, open fields, and in urban areas (Shump and Shump 1982). \r\n\r\nHardwood forests seem to be preferred over pine or cypress (Brown 1997, Ammerman et al. 2012), but studies in Missouri and Mississippi found significant use of loblolly pine and eastern red cedar as roosting substrates (Ammerman et al. 2012).  Preferences for hardwood tree species appear to vary geographically: sweetgum and black oak in Georgia; tulip poplar, sweetgum, and black gum in Maryland; tulip poplar, white oak, and pignut hickory in South Carolina; white oak and hickories in Arkansas; and oaks and sweetgum in Illinois (Ammerman et al. 2012).  The species may roost in pecan trees (Bogan and Chung-MacCoubrey 2005). \r\n\r\nThe Eastern Red Bat will forage along roads and above the tree canopy (Kern & Humphrey 1995) and at lights, for example street lights (Barbour and Davis 1969).  It often forages 549-915 m from the day roosts (Barbour and Davis 1969).  Foraging areas range from 62 \u2013 925 ha (Ammerman et al. 2012).\r\n\r\nImportant limiting factors are the availability of deciduous trees for roosting, prey, and possibly water (Mager and Nelson 2001).  In the western United States this species is a riparian obligate, roosting in riparian trees such as cottonwood and sycamore (Bogan and Chung-MacCoubrey 2005). \r\n\r\nIt commonly overwinters in areas of subfreezing temperatures (Davis and Lidicker 1956).  It survives subfreezing temperatures by raising its respiration rate, assuming a spherical shape, and covering its ventral surface with the furred tail membrane (Humphrey 1982).  It often hibernates among the leaf litter of deciduous trees on the forest floor (O'Shea and Bogan 2003, Ammerman et al. 2012).  Individuals do not become active until flying insects are available for food (Humphrey 1982).   N.
