P. nettingi has been found at elevations ranging from 750 meters (Pauley 1991) to 1378 meters (Pauley 1980, 1981). They are largely restricted to red spruce-yellow birch forest but have been found to inhabit mixed deciduous hardwoods, and scattered hemlock/spruce (Clovis 1979, Green and Pauley 1987, Pauley et al. 2005). They are associated with boulder fields, rock outcrops, and steep ravines within dense Rhododenron groves (Pauley 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCMTSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12120", "scientific_name": "Plethodon nettingi", "ITIS_TSN": "173664", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101589", "common_name": "Cheat Mountain Salamander"}}
