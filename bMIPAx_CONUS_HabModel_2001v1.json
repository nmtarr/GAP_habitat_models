It has become naturalized and is found in coastal areas from Malibu to Long Beach and coastal northwestern Orange County, the Los Angeles basin and San Garbriel Valley, and north in the San Francisco Bay area. Scattered sitings have been reported south to San Diego as well as in the Sacramento area. This introduced parakeet resides in urban parks and suburban residential areas (California Parrot Project 2013, Garrett 1997).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nThis species has also been established in the Southeast after escapees from the pet trade have begun breeding in southern Florida including Broward County since the 1980's. It is widespread, although in small numbers, in Miami, Dade County, where it sometimes breeds in dead royal palms in suburban areas (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2003, Pranty and Epps 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bMIPAx", "ELCode": "ABNQA06090", "scientific_name": "Aratinga mitrata", "ITIS_TSN": "177686", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103794", "common_name": "Mitred Parakeet"}}
