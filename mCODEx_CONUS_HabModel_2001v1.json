However, this species also occupies a variety of other habitats including margins of cleared fields, old fields, salt savannas, palmetto thickets, dry hammocks, beach dunes, pine flatwoods, mixed pine-hardwood forests, pine-turkey oak, and sand pine scrub (Wolfe and Linzoy 1977,Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Also in upland situations, rocky outcrops, ledges, cliffs and caves have know to be used (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).  Cotton mice commonly resides in thickets of dense underbrush within the surrounding forest (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), but shelter and nesting sites can also be found under decaying logs or tree stumps, in hollow trees or tree cavities, in old cabins, in rubble or brush piles, and in ground burrows (Wolfe and Linzoy 1977, Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). In Texas, this species inhabits woodlands along watercourses amidst downed logs, stumps, and vine tangles. They are frequently trapped on open field edges among woodlands, canebrakes and a variety of wooded areas. They are adept climbers and are found in hollowed trees off the ground (Schmidly 2004). They are common in the Big Thicket of southeast Texas where potential threats to habitat include conversion to pine plantations, drainage of bottomlands, and habitat fragmentation (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCODEx", "ELCode": "AMAFF03080", "scientific_name": "Peromyscus gossypinus", "ITIS_TSN": "180279", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103180", "common_name": "Cotton Deermouse"}}
