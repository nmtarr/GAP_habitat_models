Harrison and Guttman (2003) stated that the species is known from portions of the Piedmont in both North and South Carolina, the upper Coastal Plain in South Carolina, and portions of the central Coastal Plain in North Carolina. Additionally, Eurycea chamberlaini has been collected in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.  This new species corresponds with the \u201cyellow morph\u201d of Eurycea quadiadigitata, the dwarf salamander.  Chamberlain\u2019s dwarf salamanders occur in a variety of habitats but seems to prefer seepage areas near streams or ponds, particularly in Piedmont and upper Coastal Plain areas (Harrison and Guttman 2003).  They are also associated with forested wetlands.  They use fallen logs and debris for cover habitat.
