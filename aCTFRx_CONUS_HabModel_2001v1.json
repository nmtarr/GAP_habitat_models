Rocky streambeds are integral for the eggs and cover for the adults.  Also found in more sparsely vegetated areas such as chaparral, grassland and shrubby areas. This species reestablished itself quickly after the eruption of Mt. St. Helens in Washington (Lannoo 2005; Stebbins 2003).  Strong association with streams, but often adults are found into damp woods especially after rains.\r\nRange extends from west of the crest of Cascades Mountains southwest British Columbia to almost Anchor Bay, Mendocino County, California, Rocky Mountains of the extreme southeast British Columbia, Idaho and Montana. Also found in extreme southeast Washington and northeastern Oregon in the Blue and Wallowa Mountains. There are also reports in California near Big Bend, Shasta County. Isolated population in British Columbia occur at Kitimar near the coastal area and others in Crowfoot Mountains in the Shuswap Lake area (Behler and King 1979; Stebbins 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aCTFRx", "ELCode": "AAABA01010", "scientific_name": "Ascaphus truei", "ITIS_TSN": "173546", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104837", "common_name": "Coastal Tailed Frog"}}
