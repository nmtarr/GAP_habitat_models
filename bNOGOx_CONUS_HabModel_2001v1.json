However, in the Great Basin, northern goshawks have been documented foraging in shrub steppe while nesting in fragmented aspen or lodgepole stands (Younk and Bechard, 1993; Hasselblad and Bechard, 2007). Hence the selection of Great Basin shrub and steppe ecological systems as auxiliary map units. The auxiliary buffer distance of 2000 m was derived from home ranges in this habitat published by Hasselblad and Bechard (2007).\r\n\r\nWinter habitat is the same as summer with the addition of juniper woodlands (Squires and Ruggiero, 1995; Stevens, 2001; Drennan and Beier, 2003).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bNOGOx", "ELCode": "ABNKC12060", "scientific_name": "Accipiter gentilis", "ITIS_TSN": "175300", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104351", "common_name": "Northern Goshawk"}}
