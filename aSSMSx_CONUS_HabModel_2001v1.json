They retreat underground during dry or freezing weather.  They may be common in shaded hardwood forests, wooded floodplains, on the slopes of shaded ravines, and in mesic hardwood hammocks and swamp forests (Franz 1995).  They may also occasionally inhabit pinewoods in locations near hardwood bottomlands.  Breeding tends to be annual in the south and at low elevations. They lay up to about 3-dozen eggs in August-September in rotting logs, underground, or in rock crevices. The larval stage is passed in the egg with the female in attendance.  Hatching occurs in the fall in the south.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSSMSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD120G1", "scientific_name": "Plethodon grobmani", "ITIS_TSN": "208285", "Global_SEQ_ID": "999", "common_name": "Southeastern Slimy Salamander"}}
