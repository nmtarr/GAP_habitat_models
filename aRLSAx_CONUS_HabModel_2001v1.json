They are found at elevations at least 853-1494 m (Highton and Peabody 2000).  They have also been recorded in Towns County, Georgia (J. Jensen).  They may be found in moist woodland habitats, taking refuge by day under rotting logs, burrows, leaf litter or rocks, and prowling the forest floor by night.  Red-legged salamanders may also inhabit crevices in shaded rock outcrops.  Populations near and into Georgia may be restricted to deep moist gorges and high annual precipitation belts (Petranka 1998).  Eggs are probably laid in underground cavities.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRLSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12470", "scientific_name": "Plethodon shermani", "ITIS_TSN": "668323", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100811", "common_name": "Red-legged Salamander"}}
