They are common in deciduous and mixed woodlands; orchards, suburban areas, swamps, and city parks if large enough trees are available (Grubb and Pravasudov 1994, Kaufman 1996, Potter et al 1980).   Preferred Tufted Titmouse habitat has tall vegetation, high tree species diversity, and a dense canopy (Grubb and Pravasudov 1994).  Hamel (1992) suggests they prefer deciduous woods to pines, and are present in upland and bottomlands forests.  According to Fussell (1994) it is practically absent from the barrier islands.  They forage in bushes, on the ground, or in trees such as oaks, hickories, and sweetgums (Grubb and Pravasudov 1994).  They nest in a natural cavity, old woodpecker hole, or nest box, but do not excavate their own cavities (Kaufaman 1996, Potter et al 1980).  On average, the nest is 35 ft. above the ground, ranging from 3 to 90 ft. (Ehrlich et al 1988, Kaufman 1996).  N.
