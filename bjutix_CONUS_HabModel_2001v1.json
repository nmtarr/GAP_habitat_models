Found in juniper or mixed pinon-juniper woodland (Cicero 2000). Juniper titmice occur in two distinct habitat types in Arizona (Christman 2001). Occurs at elevations of 686-2,438 m (Cicero 2000). They are consistently present at lower elevations of 1450-1600 m, with primary tree species being one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), alligator juniper (J. deppeana), and Emory oak (Quercus emorii) (Christman 2001). In the canyons, Arizona white oak (Q. arizonica) dominates (Christman 2001).  In the eastern Mojave Desert, it occurs in pinon-juniper woodland mixed with Joshua trees (Cicero 2000). In Utah, can be found in areas of Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), and singleleaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla) (Cooper 2000). In southwestern Wyoming, are associated with areas of Utah juniper, with many senescent trees (Pavlacky and Anderson 2001).  In Colorado, almost 96% of birds found were in pinyon-juniper habitats (Kingery 1988). Also wanders into shrub or riparian habitats to forage in Colorado (Cicero 2000). Prefer dense areas of canopy, but can live in all kinds of canopy (Kingery 1988).\r\nIn sw. U.S., pi\u00f1on-juniper woodland may be mixed with deciduous or evergreen oaks. Juniper Titmouse uses oaks in this region (Marshall 1957, Gaddis 1987), but distribution and abundance of the species are independent of presence of oaks (Cicero 1996). In se. Arizona, where Juniper Titmouse is sympatric with Bridled Titmouse, occurrence of each species varies locally depending on distribution of preferred habitat (pi\u00f1on-juniper versus oaks, respectively; Dixon 1950, Marshall 1957, Gaddis 1987)(quoted directly from Cicero 2000).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nMost common in open juniper woodlands that are typically warm and dry (SWReGAP). This species occurs in the Upper Sonoran Zone at elevations higher than the Oak titmouse (686-2438 m) (Cicero 2000). Occupies woodlands associated with sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata) and other Great Basin shrubs in southwest Oregon and northeast California. Juniper or mixed-pinyon juniper woodlands are utilized habitat throughout the rest of this species range (Cicero 2000). In Arizona, Juniper titmouse are consistently present at lower elevations (1450-1600 m) where one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), alligator juniper (J. deppeana), and Emory oak (Quercus emorii) and Arizona white oaks (Q. arizonica) are primary tree species. Juniper titmouse also are found at higher elevations (1650-1800 m) in lower densities associated with Arizona white oak, Emory oak, Alligator juniper, with small stands of pinyon pine (Pinus discolor) (Christman 2001).  Pinyon-juniper woodlands mixed with Joshua trees are used by this species in the eastern Mojave desert (Cicero 2000, SWReGAP 2004). In Utah and southwestern Wyoming, this species can be found in Utah juniper (Junperus osteosperma), associated with single-leaf pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla) in Utah, and various senescent trees in Wyoming (SWReGAP 2004, Cooper 2000, Pavlacky and Anderson 2001). In Colorado, nearly 96% of birds were found in pinyon-juniper habitats, but also will wander into shrub or riparian habitats while foraging (SWReGAP 2004).  Juniper titmouse shows preference for areas with densce canopy cover, but can live in all canopy types (Kingery 1988).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bJUTIx", "ELCode": "ABPAW01120", "scientific_name": "Baeolophus ridgwayi", "ITIS_TSN": "650445", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105532", "common_name": "Juniper Titmouse"}}
