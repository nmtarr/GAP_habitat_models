In North Carolina, the species is rare at most localities where it has been found, but locally common in the Great Smoky Mountains (Lee et al. 1982, Clark 1987). The vole is found in cool, moist mountain forest settings, but also among high summit rock outcrops and in upper elevation grassy meadows and heath balds (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). The vole is considered by some authors to mainly inhabit conifer forests (Lee et al. 1982). However, Linzey and Linzey (1971) indicates a number of collection locations where northern hardwoods dominate. D.W. Pfitzer noted, from a survey in the Great Smoky Mountains NP, that three habitat types are used; very rocky talus slopes with no grass, open grassy areas, and one location where a specimen was taken in birch-beech forest (Linzey and Linzey 1971). Therefore, at mid and high-elevations in the southern Appalachians, the species may be more limited by the availability of suitable shelter than by forest type. High-mountain streams with varying amounts of surface rock are also noted as suitable habitat (Linzey and Linzey 1971). It prefers retreats in boulder and talus fields or log-fall areas in shaded, moist to damp forest settings. Moss-covered rock piles and logs, rock crevices, and thick leaf litter among rocks appear to be preferred denning sites (Webster et al. 1985, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). However, it also inhabits more open sites, such as mountain meadows and balds, where suitable rocky shelter is present. It also can be found in brush and slash piles of cutover areas. From Trani et al. 2007: \"In the Great Smoky Mountains and western North Carolina, it has been found at elevations ranging from 790 to 1675 m associated with mape-beech-birch stands and red spruce-fir habitat and sometimes in open balds and grassy areas (Komarek and Komarek 1938, Linzey and Linzey 1968, Adams 1987, Steele and Powell 1999).\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mROVOc", "ELCode": "AMAFF11091", "scientific_name": "Microtus chrotorrhinus carolinensis", "ITIS_TSN": "180307", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105684", "common_name": "Southern Rock Vole"}}
