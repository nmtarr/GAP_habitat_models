Other highly important habitat considerations include high tide/flood refugia of emergent Grindelia (gumplant; both at the upper edge of the marsh and within mature marshes, even at the highest high tides), seasonal use of terrestrial grassland, exploitation of suboptimal habitats, and habitat selection in brackish marsh vegetation where Sarcocornia is a relatively minor component, as often is the case in Suisun Bay marshes. Studies conducted jointly by CDFG and the DWR have shown that salt marsh harvest mouse populations are supported equally in mixed-halophyte and Sarcocornia microhabitats (Sustaita et. al. 2005). Salt marsh harvest mice are typically associated with tall, dense, continuous stands of Sarcocornia pacifica in saline soil. These stands remain mostly unsubmerged during periods of flooding, or are mixed with other unsubmerged sources of cover, such as taller vegetation (Grindelia or debris; Fisler 1965; Rice 1974; Johnson and Shellhammer 1988; Shellhammer et al. 1988; Bias and Morrison 1993; Hulst 2000). Within Sarcocornia marshes, the taller, denser stands tend to support the most salt marsh harvest mice, although they may also be abundant in tidal marshes with relatively short Sarcocornia canopies. A Sarcocornia canopy height of approximately 15 centimeters (6 inches) appears to be the lowest commonly used by salt marsh harvest mice (Fisler 1965; Shellhammer et al. 1982). The relationship between Sarcocornia height and salt marsh harvest mice abundance may depend on degree of canopy submergence rather than height alone. Stands of Schoenoplectus americanus (chairmaker's bulrush) may be important in providing unsubmerged habitat. Surveys in tidal and diked wetlands have confirmed that salt marsh harvest mice can be found using pure stands over 80 meters deep. Traps set at over one meter high have continuously captured salt marsh harvest mice at the same rate as mixed Sarcocornia wetland vegetation (Barthman-Thompson, in litt. 2009[Sustaita et al. 2011]).\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSMHMx", "ELCode": "AMAFF02040", "scientific_name": "Reithrodontomys raviventris", "ITIS_TSN": "180345", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102291", "common_name": "Salt-marsh Harvest Mouse"}}
