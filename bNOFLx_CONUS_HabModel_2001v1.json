Several subspecies of Northern Flicker exist, including the Red-shafted Flicker (Colaptes auratus cafer) in the west and the Yellow-shafted Flicker (Colaptes auratus auratus) in the east (Wiebe and Moore 2008).  It prefers forest edges and open woodlands, similar to savannas, with areas of bare ground (Wiebe and Moore 2008).  This species is most common in open woodlands, forest edges, and forests with open ground (e.g., riparian, mixed pine-hardwoods, residential and suburban areas, burned areas, clear cuts, groves, and parks; AOU 1983, Ehrlich 1988, Robertson and Kushlan 1984).  They inhabit all forest types (hardwood and coniferous) but appear to prefer hardwoods for breeding (AOU 1983).  They generally avoid dense canopy interior forest (Hamel 1992, Kaufman 1996).\r\n\r\nNorthern Flickers are associated with a variety of tree species; they nest in most tree species in the wide range of woodlands they inhabit and the degree of open or savanna-like structure of the habitat which provides space for foraging is more important than the species of tree (Wiebe and Moore 2008).  They excavate or use old cavities 6 to 100 ft above ground in dead wood, stumps and dead tree tops (Ehrlich et al. 1988).  They sometimes nest in wooden poles, buildings or earthen banks (Harrison 1978). In the Sonoran desert, they will excavate cavities in saguaro cactus, willows, and cottonwoods for nesting and roosting (Kerpez and Smith 1990, Moore 1995).   Elchuck and Wiebe (2003) found that Flickers flew up to a distance of 1,300 m from their nests in wooded areas to forage in open areas. \r\n\r\nEastern woodland types used by Northern Flickers include riparian woodlands, swamps or recently flooded or burned areas with numerous snags, beaver ponds, farm woodlots, shelter belts, and clearcuts if snags remain standing (Wiebe and Moore 2008).  \u201cIn many northern mixed-wood boreal forests, flickers are particularly common in quaking aspen stands, presumably because aspen is preferred as a nesting tree\u201d (Wiebe and Moore 2008).  Riparian woodlands are commonly used by Flickers in the Great Plains (Wiebe and Moore 2008).\r\n\r\nForest communities that support Red-shafted Flickers in the West (Colaptes auratus cafer) include subalpine (subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, limber pine, lodgepole pine), oak woodland, oak-juniper-pine woodland, pine-oak woodland, pinyon-juniper, and montane forests (yellow pine, ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, white fir, quaking aspen) (Hubbard 1965, Wagner 1984, Wiebe and Moore 2008,  Stahlecker et al. 1998).  They are found in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) (Rosenstock 1998).   Red-shafted Flickers are especially common in quaking aspen stands, riparian cottonwoods, and burned woodlands (Bock 1971, Moore 1995).  They can also be found in agricultural areas (Bock 1998).  In Colfax County, New Mexico they are residents in grazed and ungrazed rangeland consisting of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) (Goguen and Mathews 1998).  Radio-tracked individuals in Lakewood, CO used residential and commercial areas (offices), pastures, fields, and streams (Wiebe and Moore 2008).\r\n\r\nNorthern Flickers are found up to 3,545 m in elevation in the southwestern U.S.  (Moore 1995, Kingery 1998). \r\n\r\nSome northern populations of Northern Flickers are migratory and winter in the southern portion of the species range, alongside resident individuals (Wiebe and Moore 2008).  Winter habitat associations are not well known for the Northern Flicker (Wiebe and Moore 2008).  Wintering birds in southeastern Arizona will use desert grasslands and oak savannas (Bock and Bock 1998).  N.
