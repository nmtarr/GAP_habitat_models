They can be locally abundant in and around talus slopes and shaded outcrops.  Wooded slopes with friable soil and large flat rocks are good habitat as well.  They are rarely found in floodplains or on dry ridgelines (Petranka 1998).  They move underground in mid-winter and during summer dry spells. They lay cluster of about 6 eggs in spring under rocks or in underground cavities.  The larval stage is passed in the egg.  Hatching occurs in August-September.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aSRSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAD12150", "scientific_name": "Plethodon richmondi", "ITIS_TSN": "173667", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103596", "common_name": "Southern Ravine Salamander"}}
