Populations also occur west and in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, southeastern Virginia, and in the Mississippi Valley to southeastern Missouri (Buhlmann and Johnson 1995; Natureserve.org). Throughout its range, this species is found in shallow waters, temporary pools, herbaceous wetland, forested wetland, and scrub-shrub wetland (Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nThis benthic species is known to burrow in or using soil, fallen logs, and leaf litter. Hibernation takes place in mud and aquatic vegetation that surrounds lakes and other riparian zones. Land movements do not exceed 165 meters from wetlands (Buhlmann 1995; Buhlmann and Gibbons 2001). Eggs are also laid in open areas near water. Preferred habitats include shallow ponds and lakes characterized by thick and dense vegetation, cypress swamps, ephemeral pools, and ditches (Buhlmann 1995; Natureserve.org).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rCHTUx", "ELCode": "ARAAD03010", "scientific_name": "Deirochelys reticularia", "ITIS_TSN": "173786", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101923", "common_name": "Chicken Turtle"}}
