Also, south and east in areas of the Mexican Plateau that include the Chapala, Zapotlan, San Juanico, Patzcuaro, and the basin of Valle de Mexico. The elevational range comprises altitudes ranging from 800 to 2600 meters (Ernst et al. 1984; Iverson 1985).\r\n\r\nThis benthic species burrows in or using soil and can be found in big and medium sized rivers. Also associated with shallow water pools and creeks. The riparian zone it inhabits can be described as herbaceous wetland. In general, this species is found in lakes, streams, rivers, marshes, and in ponds found in grassland dominated by mesquite.\r\n\r\nOccupies areas of herbaceous wetland mostly vegetated by mesquite and grasses.\r\n\r\n*Mud turtles are considered sedentary but sometimes also move many kilometers across wetland and upland habitats to find suitable nesting areas or isolated ponds or wetlands (Natureserve.org).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rRFMTx", "ELCode": "ARAAE01030", "scientific_name": "Kinosternon hirtipes", "ITIS_TSN": "173767", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101114", "common_name": "Rough-footed Mud Turtle"}}
