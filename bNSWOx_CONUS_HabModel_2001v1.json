Brigham Young University Press, Provo, UT."], "habitat_description": "Northwest/Great Plains:\r\nDuring breeding season utilizes habitats such as coniferous or mixed forest, cedar groves, alder thickets, swamps, and tamarack bogs.  Outside of the breeding season this owl uses second growth; brushy areas, arid scrub, and open buildings outside the breeding season.  While wintering, often roosts in dense evergreens at various heights and usually close to the trunk. Rare in sub-alpine forests (Cannings 1993).\r\nIn Idaho, associated with riparian, non-deciduous forests with dense mid-canopy layer and low shrubs (Hayward and Garton 1988). Although considered unusual breeding habitat for this owl, it has bred in nest boxes in the riparian willow (Salix)/Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) shrub-steppe desert habitat of sw. Idaho (Marks and Doremus 1988)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).\r\nIn British Columbia, Cannings (1987) found that Saw-whet Owl densities are 2.5 times higher in deciduous woodlands than in pine-fir woodlands. In nw. British Columbia, all Saw-whet Owl nests were located in deciduous trees (e.g., birch, poplar, cottonwood [Populus]). In spring on the Queen Charlotte Is., the location of calling Saw-whet Owls is closer to riparian habitat, has more old growth forest (>120 years) and has more young forest than random sites (10-30 years; Gill and Cannings 1997). No relationship exists here between the location of calling Saw-whet Owls and elevation, distance to saltwater, dominant tree species, and distance to other habitat types (Gill and Cannings 1997)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).\r\nIn Wyoming, strongly associated with stands dominated primarily by coniferous species but in which aspen (Populus tremuloides) dominates the overstory, probably because the coniferous species provide good cover for roosting and the aspen stands provide optimal nesting habitat (Anderson and Clark 2002). Appears to avoid clear cuts and open sagebrush habitats (P = 0.01): average distance of calling Saw-whet Owls to clear cuts = 1,285 m (4,216 feet; Anderson and Clark 2002). In w. Wyoming, elevation of calling sites are between 1,777 m (5,830 feet) and 2,692 m (8,832 feet) (n = 77; Anderson and Clark 2002)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).\r\nIn n. Colorado, Saw-whet Owls were detected in riparian habitats at 1,900 m (6,234 feet) and spruce-fir forests at 3,000 m (9,843 feet) elevation; none detected in unbroken stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) (Palmer 1986). Webb (1982) found them in a variety of habitats between 1,930 m (6,332 feet) and 3100 m (10,171 feet), including Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii)/ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecotones, spruce-fir forests, and aspen surrounded by lodgepole pine. In addition, in the foothills and low mountains of Colorado, the species occurs mostly in ponderosa pine or ponderosa-pine/Douglas-fir (Arceuthobium douglasii) forests, as well as lodgepole pine, spruce-fir, and montane riparian forest (Andrews and Righter 1992)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).\r\n \r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe preferred habitat of this species is dense forests or woodlands which are associated with water.  Common in ponderosa pine forests, and often breeds in riparian woodland in shrub-steppe environments, foraging there in sagebrush and antelope brush habitats (Cannings 1993). Some have been found in agricultural areas, deserts, and in cities (Cannings 1993).  In Nevada, this species can be seen in the coniferous forests of the higher mountain ranges where alpine streams and small lakes are usually present; it is not present in valley bottoms (Alcorn 1988, Ammon 2005).  In Utah, resident of aspens, pinyon-juniper, and streamside forests; frequently winters in the valleys, especially in abandoned buildings (Hayward et al. 1976). Prefer dead snags for nesting (Herron et al. 1985). In Boulder, Colorado, occurs at 1,700-3,200 m (Cannings 1993). Generally found between 1,524 and 2,287 m in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004). During migration in New Mexico, may occur at lower elevations (854-2,287 m) (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2004). Rare in sub-alpine forests (Cannings 1993).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nThe range of the northern saw whet owl is restricted to contiguous forests of spruce-fir and northern hardwood (Simpson 1992) in or near the Canadian zone of the Appalachian mountains (Crutchfield 1990). They nest in mature spruce-fir or northern hardwood forests containing large trees with cavities for nesting (Johnsgard 1988, Cannings 1993); utilizes forest openings and edges for foraging (Cannings 1993). They breed in dense coniferous or mixed forest, cedar groves, alder thickets, swamps, and tamarack bogs (NATURE SERVE). Occurs in isolated pockets of boreal forest over 4500 ft. elevation. Although it primarily inhabits Spruce-fir forests, it also occurs in hardwood transition zones. Breeding sites appear to be confined to mature forest with trees generally 9-11 inches or larger in diameter with well-developed understories (NATURE SERVE).  Preference is for boreal Spruce-fir forests in South East, which are currently dying out. The degree to which it prospers in Northern Hardwood and High Elevation Red Oak forests may determine persistence (NATURE SERVE).\r\nNests in cavities in dead trees and snags. Such cavities are generally located 14-60 ft. above ground. It is also known to use bird boxes, and rock cavities (NC).   Nests in cavities made by woodpeckers (usually Norther Flicker, Colaptes auratus, and Pileated Woodpecker, Dryocopus pileatus) that average about 7.5 cm in diameter, These cavities may be in living or dead conifer or hardwood trees (Johnsgard 1988).\r\nIn Maryland, heard most often in coniferous swamps dominated by red spruce (Picea rubens), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum), as well as in plantations of red spruce and red pine (Pinus resinosa) (Brinker and Dodge 1993)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).\r\nIn Southern Appalachian Mountains, species is a resident above 1,067 m (3,500 feet) in mixed forests dominated by red spruce, Fraser fir (Abies fraseri), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) (Simpson 1968, 1972; Barb 1995). In Tennessee, juveniles reported at 375 m (1,230.31 feet) in primarily deciduous habitat with a few conifers, suggesting possible breeding at lower elevations in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (McKinney and Owen 1989)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).\r\nTree species present, with a diameter at breast height of > 10 cm, at a successful nesting site in Virginia (elevation 1,158 m, 3,799 feet) were in decreasing order of abundance: American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red spruce, black cherry (Prunus serotina), black locust (Robinia pseudocacia), red maple (Acer rubrum), and northern red oak (Quercus rubrum)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).\r\n\r\nAll Regions Winter:\r\nIn Connecticut, utilized mixed mature old growth forest adjacent to water, rivers, marshes, or streams (Petit 1995). Individuals wintering on Assateague I., MD used pine woods significantly more often than expected and used open/marsh habitats significantly less often than expected, based on equal use of available habitats; other habitats were not used significantly differently from expected, based on availability (Churchill et al. 2002). In central New Jersey, wintered in wetland second-growth and mature woodlands (> 40.5 ha). Saw-whet Owls wintering in central Iowa used both early and late successional woodland (Dinsmore and Clark 1991). In general, the presence of dense vegetation for roosting and perches for foraging is apparently critical (Cannings 1993)(quoted directly from Rasmussen et al. 2008).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bNSWOx", "ELCode": "ABNSB15020", "scientific_name": "Aegolius acadicus", "ITIS_TSN": "177942", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106412", "common_name": "Northern Saw-whet Owl"}}
