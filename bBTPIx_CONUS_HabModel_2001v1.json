Rubus spp and Prunus spp. Cascara, madrone, and elderberries.  Diet changes seasonally. In northern habitats in spring feeds on ag ranges and immature fruit; elderberries in summer, cascara, madrone in late summer-early autumn. Year round nomadic and moves with the availability of food. Important habitat management: closed canopy forests for nest sites; open canopy forests for foraging and presence of mineral springs/licks. This species is also dependent on the food supply of annual mast or acorn crop. This crop determines the route of migration and wintering ground; forest edges only are included for the habitat of this species. Summer resident of the Sandia mountains in New Mexico; abundant in mixed conifer communities; common from ponderosa pine to spruce-fir; will summer in the Mogollan Mountains of New Mexico. Found in winter in Arizona in yellow-pine forest, elevation (1981 m). Found in northern Arizona at breeding time in Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)  communities and Ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) communities, with an herbaceous understory of Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) and blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis). Found in mixed-coniferous forests in the White Mountains of Arizona.  Columba fasciata requires mature conifers or broad leaved trees at least 8 feet tall for nesting; additionally, needs a source of mineral water or salt deposits in early fall and winter; cultivated agricultural lands included in ecosystems.\r\nIn interior U.S., inhabits montane conifer or mixed-species forest dominated by pines and oaks at 1,600\u20132,700 m elevation (1 nest at 3,500 m, above snow line in New Mexico; Neff 1947); generally absent from intervening, large, lower-elevation desert scrub community except for overflying and localized feeding. In Colorado and high elevations farther south (n. Arizona and New Mexico), occupies Pine\u2013Douglas-fir forest and West-ern and Southwestern spruce-fir communities (Engelmann spruce [Picea engelmanni], Douglas-fir, subalpine fir [Abies lasiocarpa], lodgepole pine [Pinus contorta], ponderosa pine) with abundant berry-producing shrubs. In s. Utah, 53% of Band-tailed Pigeons observed (n = 228) were in Gambel\u2019s oak (Q. gambelii)-dominated communities (Pederson and Nish 1975). Oaks and large-seeded pi\u00f1on pines (Pinus edulis, P. monophylla) become increasingly abundant in inhabited uplands of s. Utah southward. In Oak-juniper and Juniper-pi\u00f1on communities in s. Arizona and New Mexico and w. Texas; on Mica Mtn., se. Arizona, principally in ponderosa-pine and white fir communities (Marshall 1956). In Arizona, also occasionally feeds in chaparral, desert grassland, and Sonoran desert scrub (Braun et al. 1975). Also along Sierra Nevada east of Central Valley; inhabits xeric Mixed conifer forest (white fir [Abies concolor], ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa], Douglas fir) and Red fir forest (Abies magnifica) to 36\u00b0N. Found in oaks (California black oak [Q. kelloggii], Garry oak [Q. garryana]) that are increasingly abundant from s. Oregon southward as conditions become more xeric. West of Central Valley, southward through Central Coast, Transverse, and Peninsular physiographic provinces, inhabits increasingly diverse local vegetative communities and topography. California oak woods (live oaks [Q. agrifolia, Q. wislizenii, Q. chrysolepis]), pines (Pinus coulteri, P. sabiniana) and Chaparral (chamise [Adenostoma sp.], manzanita [Arctostaphylos], lilac [Ceanothus]) prevail, often patchy, south to Baja California. Resident in urban and suburban coastal California with abundant oaks, Monterey pine (P. radiata), manzanita, Acacia species, and other evergreens. Transient across semiarid shrub and scrub-steppe of South Eastern Deserts in s. California; most common in upland mixed-species forest where oaks, pi\u00f1on pine (P. monophylla), lilacs, and manzanita abundant (quoted directly from Keppie and Braun 2000).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nInhabits predominantly temperate, conifer rain forest, from tidewater to 300 m elevation, in varying mixtures of sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis; most prevalent n. Washington northward), red cedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and red alder (Alnus rubra), especially where ages and structure well dispersed (Jeffrey 1989). Common fruiting shrubs in inhabited Coast Range are cascara (Rhamnus purshiana), elderberry (Sambucus spp.), Pacific madrone, cherries (Prunus spp.) and huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.). On western Cascade slopes, in silver fir (Abies amabilis)\u2013Douglas-fir forest. Occasionally east of Cascade Range in Washington, generally at orchards. In n. California, in Mixed Evergreen forest (Quercus-Arbutus-Pseudotsuga) and more locally in Redwood forest (Sequoia sempervirens); abundant throughout year in shrub/sapling stands where tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus, 19% of total foliage volume), Douglas fir (15%) and Paci-fic madrone (10%) most prevalent (Marcot 1984)(quoted directly from Keppie and Braun 2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBTPIx", "ELCode": "ABNPB01080", "scientific_name": "Patagioenas fasciata", "ITIS_TSN": "676899", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103830", "common_name": "Band-tailed Pigeon"}}
