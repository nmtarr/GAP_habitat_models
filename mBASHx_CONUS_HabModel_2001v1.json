Africa in the 1950's. Aoudad has been documented to directly compete with native species for resources. Whether aoudad can be labeled as grazers or browsers depends on local conditions of ranges. Aoudad in sparsely vegeteted slopes in New Mexico subsist mainly on on mountain mahogany and whatever oak species abound. Grass is also an important part of their diet. Aoudad numbers fluctuate with vegatation abundance which in turn is dependant on winter rains. Aoudad are able to get by on limited moisture other then dew and plant juice. Rock outcrops, cliffs and slopes have an important role in the life and population dynamics of this species. Rutting activities center around rocky points. Rocky points are always a focal point. For the last third of gestation and the first month of lactation ewes stay very close to their rocks.\r\nIn New Mexico, this species is found in the Canadian River Canyon of Harding County, Hondo Canyon in Chavez and Lincoln Counties, on the west side of the Guadalupe Mts. in Otero County, and Largo Canyon in San Juan County (Schmidt & Gilbert 1978).\r\nIn California, the Barbary sheep is an uncommon resident of the Hearst Ranch in San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties where they occur in valley foothill hardwoods and annual grassland habitats. They utilize rocky areas for cover especially during the spring lambing season. Forage consists mainly of grasses and browse to a lesser extent. During fall and winter, Barbary sheep spend a majority of their time in annual grasslands, while oak woodlands are important during hot summers (Barrett 1966, 1979, Johnston 1979, Ogren 1965, [Hopkins et al. 2005 for CAWHR] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nThis species was introduced to Texas in the Palo Duro Canyon near Armarillo in 1957-1958. It is also present along much of the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado, in the Trans-Pecos, as well as on the Edwards Plateau, South Texas Plains, Rolling Plains, and Post Oak Savannah regions. Schmidt & Gilbert (1978) list this species as occupying Palo Duro Canyon, Palo Pinto, Stephens, and Brewster Counties. Barbary sheep in Texas utilize dry, rough, barren, and arid habitats where they forage on a variety of grasses, forbs, and shrubs (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mBASHx", "ELCode": "AMALE05010", "scientific_name": "Ammotragus lervia", "ITIS_TSN": "180719", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100764", "common_name": "Barbary Sheep"}}
