Habitat coincides closely with narrow coastal belt of high rainfall and abundant cloudy weather from central California to British Columbia (Grinnell 1904). In northern CA, uses coniferous forest and adjacent deciduous woodlands, redwood [Sequoia sempervirens], Douglas fir, Bishop pine [P. muricata], and mixed conifer) as well as broadleaved evergreen and willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.) riparian forests (Grinnell and Miller 1944, Shuford 1992). Inhabits plantings of pines, cypress (Cupressus spp.), and Eucalyptus spp., but edges of oak woodlands sparingly. In Marin Co., breeds most commonly on coastal ridges in denser, moister forests and in interior and northern portions of the county to moist drainages of narrow canyons, north-facing slopes with larger planted areas of pines, cypress, and eucalyptus (Shuford 1992). In Contra Costa Co., planted Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) stands used extensively during breeding (Kleintjes and Dahlsten 1992, 1994). In coastal California, occupies forest habitats from sea level to 1,700 m. In El Dorado Co., Blodgett Forest Research Station, uses mixed-conifer forests on mid-slope of w. Sierra Nevada between 1,200 m and about 1,700 m elevation. Chestnut-backed Chickadees tend to nest in denser, more closed canopy stands compared to more open parklike stands for Mountain Chickadee (Brennan et al. 1999b). In addition, Chestnut-backed Chickadee forages significantly more on California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) and Douglas fir, and Mountain Chickadee more on ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) and sugar (P.lambertiana) pines and white fir (Abies concolor) throughout the year. Seasonally, both chickadees increase amount of time foraging on white fir during breeding season, sugar pine during summer, and incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens) during winter (Brennan et al. 2000). In Washington, on San Juan and Orcas Is., uses open, rocky, moss-covered knolls with scattered short madrone and Douglas fir, and other deciduous shrubs. In mainland Washington, found primarily in Douglas-fir forests with well-developed brushy understories (Sturman 1968a). In Washington and in Canada, overlaps with Black capped Chickadee; Chestnut-backed Chickadee has stronger preference for coniferous-forest habitat (Smith 1991) and a less diverse foraging style (Smith 1967, Sturman 1968)(quoted directly from Dahlsten et al. 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bCBCHx", "ELCode": "ABPAW01070", "scientific_name": "Poecile rufescens", "ITIS_TSN": "554387", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104851", "common_name": "Chestnut-backed Chickadee"}}
