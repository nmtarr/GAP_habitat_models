It can be found across the Great Plains, from southern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, western Missouri, and south Kansas into west and central Texas. This species occupies vast areas of the Chihuahuan Desert and also northern Sonoran Desert regions into the Mogollon Plateau of central Arizona. Also found in northwestern Sinaloa, southeast to central Durango, Nuevo Leon, and northern Tamaulipas, Mexico (Jones and Lovich 2009). In Arizona, this species is found in Semidesert Grassland, Interior Chaparral, and lower reaches of Petran Montane Conifer Forest (Brennan and Holycross 2009). In Colorado, it occurs at elevations below 1370m for populations found in southeastern Colorado and in the Republican River drainage; also below 1890m south of the Arkansas River along the south area of Big Sandy Creek. It inhabits rocky slopes, canyon bottoms, floodplains, areas near irrigation ditches, and riparian zones (Hammerson 1999). In New Mexico, this species is found along riparian zones of major rivers and tributaries. Also found in mesquite sand hills near Loco Hills, Eddy County, near Elephant Butte Dam, malpais at Grants, lower slopes of the Sandia Mountains, south Albuquerque, and around Sitting Bull Falls in the Guadalupe Mountains. This species has been also found in the edges of playas in the Jornada del Muerto, and in drainages between the Organ Mountains and the Rio Grande in Dona Ana County (Degenhardt et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nSW\t-Creosote Bush desert, desert grassland, riparian corridors, pinon/juniper woodlands, and pine/oak woodlands (Jones and Lovich 2009).\r\n\r\nGP\t-Open prairie, riparian zones, desert grassland.
