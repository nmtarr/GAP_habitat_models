Adults may disperse into wooded terrestrial habitats in wet warm weather. In New York, they are rarely found on soils of low pH (Wyman 1988, Wyman and Jancola 1992).  Eggs are typically are laid on underside of submerged rocks, logs, or aquatic plants from April-June (Johnson and Goldberg 1975).  The female remains with the eggs for an incubation period of about 30 days.  The larvae metamorphose in 2-3 years (Wilder 1924).  Most individuals are sexually mature during the second fall after metamorphosis in New York (Stewart 1956).  Bahret (1996) found eggs in a lake at depths of 9.0-13.5 m, on the topmost leaves of water moss, far from shore and from surface drainage inlets.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aNTLSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05010", "scientific_name": "Eurycea bislineata", "ITIS_TSN": "173685", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105466", "common_name": "Northern Two-lined Salamander"}}
