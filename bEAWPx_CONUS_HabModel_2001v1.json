This species appears to be slightly partial to deciduous woods, but is very common in almost every patch of woods, and can even adapt to pure stands of pine.  The use of coniferous habitat by this species is more common in the southern US (McCarty 1996). The eastern wood-pewee will utilize mature forests, open pine, wooded residential areas, farm woodlots, borders of fields, clearings roadsides, and open to medium-growth woods in rather dry situations (Hamel 1992). Although the species does not use white pine-hemlock, it will use other pine-scrub oak habitats (Hamel 1992).  The size of forest fragments does not appear to be an important factor for habitat selection (McCarty 1996).  This species prefers forest clearings and edges, such as those around meadows, roadsides, and ponds (Kaufman 1996, McCarty 1996).  The eastern wood-pewee is often found in riparian areas in the midwest, but tends to avoid streams in eastern forests (Mccarty 1996). M.
