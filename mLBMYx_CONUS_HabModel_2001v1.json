During the summer, the species roosts in: barns and other buildings (Cagle and Cockrum, 1943; Davis and Hitchcock, 1965; Buchler, 1976; Humphrey and Cope, 1976; Anthony and Kunz, 1977; Anthony et al., 1981; Barclay, 1982; Henry et al., 2002); in trees cavities and under sloughing bark (Humphrey and Cope, 1976; Schowalter et al., 1979; Barclay and Cash, 1985; Crampton and Barclay, 1996; Kalcounis and Hecker, 1996; Chung-MacCoubrey, 1999); and in caves (Davis and Hitchcock, 1965; Worthington, 1991; Ports and Bradley, 1996; Agosta et al., 2005). Tree roosts are often in Populus spp. and have been documented within stands of aspen and spruce (Barclay and Cash, 1985; Crampton and Barclay, 1996; Kalcounis and Hecker, 1996), spruce-fir and spruce-fir-birch forests (Broders and Forbes, 2004), and riparian cottonwood forest (Chung-MacCoubrey, 1999).\r\n\r\nThe small brown myotis has been documented foraging over: sewage lagoons (Worthington, 1991; Tigner and Stukel, 2003); brush and openings in the forest canopy (Buchler, 1976); rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes (Fenton, 1970; Lunde and Harestead, 1986; Saunders and Barclay, 1992; Feldhammer et al., 2009; Clare et al., 2011); in upper canopy of northeastern deciduous forest (Buchler, 1980); ponderosa pine forest (Herd and Fenton, 1983); fields adjacent to water (Herd and Fenton, 1983); and riparian cottonwoods and shrubs (Saunders and Barclay, 1992).\r\n\r\nThe species has been documented in the following habitats: southern IL oak-hickory (Carroll et al., 2002; Feldhammer et al., 2009); open fields (Fenton, 1970; Moosam et al., 2012); roads (Moosam et al., 2012); subalpine low shrubland with sagebrush and aspen (Foster et al., 1997); subalpine grassland with spruce and aspen (Foster et al., 1997); willows and aspen (Lengas, 1994 as cited in Oliver, 2000); riparian willows and aspen (Lengas, 1994 as cited in Oliver, 2000); mixed conifer forest with willow and aspen (Lengas, 1994 as cited in Oliver, 2000); riparian cottonwood and willow (Ports and Bradley, 1996); high elevation conifer forests in Nevada, with juniper, white fir, subalpine fir, spruce, pinyon pine, limber pine, and bristlecone pine (Ports and Bradley, 1996); deciduous forest (NV) of aspen, cottonwood, shrubs (Ports and Bradley, 1996); ponds with willow or spruce-fir woodland (Storz and Williams, 1996); and closed canopy riparian elm and cottonwood (Kunz, 1973). Neither roosting nor foraging was specifically documented in these studies, so these occurrences may represent transient individuals or merely passage en route to/from roost or forage sites.\r\n\r\nFindley et al. (1975) asserted that those individuals not within proximity to large, permanent water bodies were transients. Direct observation confirms maximum distances of roughly 2000 m between roost sites and forage sites or water sources (Buchler, 1976; Davis and Hitchcock, 1965; Humphrey and Cope, 1976; Lunde and Harestead, 1986; Broders et al., 2006).\r\n\r\nThe species avoids open grasslands and meadows (Schowalter et al., 1979; Storz and Williams, 1996) and clearcuts (Lunde and Harestead, 1986) and is seldom known to forage within forests (Lunde and Harestead, 1986; Saunders and Barclay, 1992; Crampton and Barclay, 1996), with Buchler (1980) and Herd and Fenton (1983) providing the only evidence of such activity.\r\n\r\nElevation constraints are not documented for the eastern U.S., though it has been observed as low as 150 m and up to 760 m in Maryland and Pennsylvannia (Agosta et al., 2005). Western individuals have been documented at elevations ranging from 1311 m in Utah (Oliver, 2000) to 3700 m in CO (Storz and Williams, 1996). Expert review for the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project indicated the species presence down to 1157 m.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mLBMYx", "ELCode": "AMACC01010", "scientific_name": "Myotis lucifugus", "ITIS_TSN": "179988", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100473", "common_name": "Little Brown Myotis"}}
