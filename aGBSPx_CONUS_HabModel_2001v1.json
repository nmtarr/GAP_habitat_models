In Wyoming, ranges from the proximity of Alcova in Natrona County up to 2800 meters in elevation (Stebbins 2003). Found throughout the Great Basin and bordering areas of semidesert shrublands, pinon-juniper woodlands, sagebrush flats, and up high elevation areas of the spruce-fir belt in Cedar Breaks, Utah. Also found in agricultural areas of the Columbian Basin of eastern Washington (Stebbins 2003). In other words, its range extends from south British Columbia south to east California, then east to Colorado, Utah northwestern New Mexico (Behler and King 1979). Habitat includes prairies, alkali flats, and open ponderosa pine communities (Lannoo 2005). Found in northern Arizona, this species is known to occupy areas of the Great Basin Desertscrub to Petran Montane Conifer Forest (Brennan and Holycross 2009). No longer found in urbanized areas (Leonard et al. 1993; Orchard 1992), while persisting in artificial reservoirs used as breeding sites. Breeding in natural settings occurs in sluggish streams, springs and other permanent and temporary water bodies (Stebbins 1985).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aGBSPx", "ELCode": "AAABF02030", "scientific_name": "Spea intermontana", "ITIS_TSN": "206991", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104930", "common_name": "Great Basin Spadefoot"}}
