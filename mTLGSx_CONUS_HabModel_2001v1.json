It inhabits open areas with sparse vegetation, such as originally occurred in sandy short-grass prairie, but shrublands, beaches, and dry pine barrens are also used (NatureServe2014).  This species appears to be much more abundant and more widely distributed than it was a century ago, for much shortgrass habitat suitable to its needs, such as mowed lawns, golf courses, cemeteries, and rights-of-way has been developed by man (Whitaker & Hamilton 1998, Jones and Birney 1988).  In CO they prefer low bunchgrasses and inhabit semidesert shrublands, and in MO, they inhabit prairies and occasionally brushy fencerows, woody borders or sandy river bottoms (Schwartz and Schwartz 2001).
