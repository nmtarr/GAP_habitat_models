The southern Appalachian Mountains are the southern limit of the shrew's range, where it is found in high-elevation deciduous and coniferous forest types (Linzey and Linzey 1971).  In New England, they inhabit \u201ccold, deep, damp coniferous forests in boreal pockets\u201d up to 6,000 ft where they dwell in \u201cmoist moss-covered logs, in crevices of large mossy rock piles, among shaded, wooded rock slides or talus, just beneath low, shaded cliffs, and at the edges of moist grassy clearings surrounded by swampy woods\u201d (Godin 1977).  Trapping results reported by Richmond and Grimm (1950) suggest that long-tailed shrews spend most of their time in the labyrinth of spaces between rocks about a foot beneath the surface.  Nest sites are usually associated with natural subterranean tunnels among boulder crevices.  Breeding occurs in spring and summer, possibly from late April to August (Kirkland and Van Deuen 1979).  One or two litters may be produced with two to five young per litter (Richmond and Grimmy 1950; Tatey 1935).   Sexual maturity is reached in less than a year. Like other shrews, this species probably does not survive beyond about 18 months.  Stacy Smith, 12June05 & N.
