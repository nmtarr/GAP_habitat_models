In the SWReGAP region, this species breeds only in certain mountain ranges in Utah and Nevada (Johnson 2002).    Overall breeding distribution is spotty because it is restricted to island alpine systems on higher mountain ranges, but this bird is relatively common in appropriate habitat (Behle 1981). \r\n\r\nThe black rosy-finch is a summer resident in Utah (Hayward et al. 1976) where it breeds in higher mountain ranges in northern, central and southeastern parts of state.  It is known to breed in Utah in the Raft River, Uinta, La Sal, and Tushar Mountains, and in the Wasatch Range from Brighton to Mt. Timpanogos, and possibly in the Deep Creek Range (Behle 1955; Behle et al. 1963; Behle 1985; Johnson 2002).  It is most abundant in Utah in the Uinta Mountains, less common in the Wasatch, and rare in other smaller and more remote mountain ranges (Behle 1985).  Breeds in Nevada in the Santa Rosa, Independence, Jarbidge, E. Humboldt, Snake, and Ruby Mountains (Johnson 2002).  It has not been found in the in Toiyabe Range, Toquima Range, White Pine Mountains, or Schell Creek Range in Nevada, or in the Stansbury Mtns, or Henry Mtns of Utah (Johnson 2002).  Breeding and wintering range overlap in some areas (Johnson 2002). SWReGAP generated separate breeding and wintering range maps and models for this species because of differing seasonal distributions and land cover associations.\r\n\r\nBreeding occurs in alpine-arctic areas above timberline (Behle 1981; Johnson 2002) and therefore is restricted to summits of only the highest mountain ranges (French 1959a; Hayward et al. 1976).   Breeding habitat is always in rocky areas, especially vertical cliffs with cracks and holes for nesting, but the black rosy-finch may nest on the ground in talus slopes (French 1959b; Behle 1981). Nest sites often overlook snowfields and glaciers and are usually on north side of cliff where snow lasts through summer (Lichtwardt 2000; Johnson 2002).  It feeds in areas near appropriate nest sites (up to 4 km away), including shores of alpine lakes, meadows (especially rocky meadows), tundra, fellfields, rock slides, snow fields, and glaciers (Johson 2002). It especially favors feeding in snow patches and margins of receding snow where it eats seeds and insects (French 1959b; Johnson 2002).   Limiting factors to breeding appear to be the aridity of the mountain range (not enough snow) and the lack of rock outcrops; also appropriate nesting habitat may not be extensive enough in area to support breeding (French 1959a).  \r\n\r\nThe black rosy-finch is found only above timberline during the breeding season, but nesting can also occur in areas of alpine conditions at elevations where trees survive.  It does not breed below 2,743 m in the SWReGAP region; most breeding in the area occurs above 3,352 m (French 1959b; Johnson 2002).  It will breed at lower elevations in more northern areas of its range, down to 2,438 m (French 1959a). Breeding is known from elevations as high as 2,620 m (Johnson 2002).  French (1959a) stated that there is likely no upward elevation limit to breeding since this bird\u2019s relatives live at 5,486 m in central Asia (French 1959a).  Temperature may determine lower limits of breeding elevation (Johnson 2002).  \r\n\r\nAlpine tundra and other suitable breeding habitats are used in the winter when weather conditions are fair enough that the birds can reach them; within-season movements between alpine and subalpine areas are known to occur (Johnson 2002).  When conditions are too treacherous or snow accumulation is too high, mountain wintering flocks use high open parks and valleys (Johnson 2002).  Some birds migrate to non-mountainous areas where they inhabit the broad, thinly vegetated lowlands and high deserts of shadscale (Atriplex), greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus), sagebrush (Artemisia), rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus), and open pi\u00f1on (Pinus monophylla)-juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), and occasionally on plains east of the Rockies.  Wintering birds roost communally in crevices and structures such as abandoned buildings, culverts, old mine shafts, and bridges (Johnson 2002).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBLRFx", "ELCode": "ABPBY02010", "scientific_name": "Leucosticte atrata", "ITIS_TSN": "179222", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105480", "common_name": "Black Rosy-finch"}}
