(1996) state this species frequents a variety of habitats- coniferous forests, woodland, swampland, coastal marshes, river bottoms, farmland, prairie, chaparral, and desert.  This species is found near rock outcrops and clumps of vegetation, and under rotting logs, old lumber, and rocks (Stebbins 2003).  Species is found in low, hilly semi-desert shrubland, irrigated fields, cottonwood-Russian olive groves, and plains grasslands (Hammerson).  In New Mexico, preferred habitat is riparian (majority of collections have been along principal river systems) or grassland, but some are found in pinon-juniper, and low elevation desert areas (Degenhardt et al. 1996).  This species uses all kinds of surface cover, but in desert areas it uses rock outcrops or rodent burrows (as long as it is sufficient depth to escape hot dry conditions); it often uses old houses, barns, foundations, wells, and cisterns for retreats (Degenhardt et al. 1996).  In New Mexico can be found from 900-1800m (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Stebbins (2003) states this snake can be found from sea level to 2130m.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rCKINx", "ELCode": "ARADB19020", "scientific_name": "Lampropeltis getula", "ITIS_TSN": "209247", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101531", "common_name": "Common Kingsnake"}}
