These isolated populations are currently present in coastal California around Monterey Bay (Green et al. 2013).\r\nBreeding habitat includes a wide variety of damp places including seeps (Hamilton et al. 1998), backwaters of slow flowing streams (Beneski et al. 1986; Hamilton et al. 1998; Llewelyn and Peterson 1998), ephemeral low elevation ponds (Leonard and Klaus 1994), but also large and permanent bodies of water at higher elevations (Pilliod 2001). Other sites reported include highly disturbed and newly formed shallow pools (Beneski et al. 1986; Monello and Wright 1999). \r\nAs adults, this species occupies a wide variety of habitats including sagebrush steppes, semiarid grassland, alpine meadows, humid coniferous forests, beaver ponds, dry oak woodlands, rocky shorelines, subalpine lakes, pastures, and even disturbed areas like residential green areas (Lannoo 2005; Hamilton et al. 1998; Leonard et al. 1993). It is important to mention that migratory movements for this species does not only occur over obvious suitable habitats (Beneski et al. 1986). \r\nAdults are described as subterranean when not in breeding season; cover is provided by logs, rodent burrows, bark, rocks, rotten wood, all usually within 100 meters from the water (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Powell et al. 1997). \r\n\r\nLarvae may avoid predation by hiding under bottom detritus, logs, and aquatic vegetation (Petranka 1998).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aLTOPx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01080", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma macrodactylum", "ITIS_TSN": "173601", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106403", "common_name": "Long-toed Salamander"}}
