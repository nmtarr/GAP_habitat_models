Populations occur in the northern region of the Florida peninsula and the southern reaches of the Florida panhandle, and also in North Carolina where this species can be found in the Lower Coastal Plain south of the Neuse River. In Georgia, this species is commonly found on the Fall Line sandhills and some of the Georgia\u2019s sea islands (Timmerman and Martin 2003).\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, this species occurs in the lower Coastal Plain. It has been reported this area was dominated by wiregrass and longleaf pine. Populations in Mississippi are primarily distributed in the southern part of the state. In this region, longleaf pine hills and pine flats are the reported preferred zones occupied by this species (Timmerman and Martin 2003). Populations in Louisiana are near extirpation and the record of distribution in the state lacks recent reports (Natureserve.org). \r\n\r\nThis species also occurs in islands of the states of South Carolina and Florida. Reports describe populations found in patches in the lower and middle Coastal Plain of South Carolina, and also in the coastal marsh-sea island area; Edisto and three smaller barrier islands. Occurrences have been reported in the Florida Keys and most of the west and east coast barrier islands (Ashton and Ashton 1981; Conant and Collins 1998; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Mount 1975; Timmerman and Martin 2003).\r\n\r\nThe habitat of this species includes grassland, riparian zones, savanna, shrubland, chaparral, conifer and hardwood to mixed woodland. In more detail, the preferred habitats are associated with pine and wiregrass flatwoods, longleaf pine-turkey oak hills, pine-palmetto flatwoods, xeric hammocks, mesophytic and coastal maritime hammocks. Also, barrier islands and coastal scrub, wet savannas, wet prairies (in dry periods), mixed pine hardwood, successional woodland (Campbell and Lamar 2004; Dundee and Rossman 1989; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Hammerson 2007; Mount 1975; Palmer and Braswell 1995; Tennant 1997).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEDBRx", "ELCode": "ARADE02010", "scientific_name": "Crotalus adamanteus", "ITIS_TSN": "174309", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101938", "common_name": "Eastern Diamond-backed Rattlesnake"}}
