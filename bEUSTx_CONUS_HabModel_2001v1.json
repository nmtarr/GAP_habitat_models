Documented nesting habitats include: residential areas (Igl and Johnson, 1997); urban areas (Royall, 1966), especially those with abundant exotic flora (Mills et al., 1989); orchards (Humphrey et al., 1985); aspen woodlands (Martin et al., 2004); riparian forests in the semi-arid west (Walcheck, 1970; Smith, 1975; Weitzl, 1988; Wauer, 1997); juniper woodlands (Smith, 1975); windbreaks (Smith, 1975); and oak-pine savanna (Verner et al., 1997). Nests tend to be in close proximity to edges, particularly those near herbaceous or agricultural habitats (Kerpez and Smith, 1990; Peterson and Gauthier, 1995; Verner et al., 1997; Aitken and Martin, 2004; Martin et al., 2004).\r\n\r\nEuropean starlings forage in: cropland (Royall, 1966; Williamson and Gray, 1975; Fischl and Caccamise, 1985; White et al., 1985); feedlots (White et al., 1985; LeJeune et al., 2008; Gaukler et al., 2012); pasture (Jones, 1950; Williamson and Gray, 1975; Verner et al., 1997); lawns (Royall, 1966; Williamson and Gray, 1975); salt marshes in the eastern U.S. (Reinert and Mello, 1995; McBroom, 2007); shrub-steppe, with a prominent herbaceous component (Smith, 1975); juniper savanna/steppe (Maser and Gashwiler, 1977); meadows (Williamson and Gray, 1975); and urban areas (Fischl and Caccamise, 1985). The species does not forage in tallgrass environments until mowed, burned, or grazed (Verner et al., 1997; Van Dyke et al., 2004).\r\n\r\nAdditional individuals have been documented without note of particular use in: small patches of mixed aspen-conifer interspersed with grasslands (Peterson and Gauthier, 1995; Aitken and Martin, 2004); golf courses and urban parks (Mills et al., 1989; Moul and Elliott, 1994; Blair, 1996; Merola-Swartjes and DeLong, 2005); developed urban areas (Dolber et al., 1978; Blair, 1996; Mancke and Gavin, 2000); riparian forests in urban areas (Rosenberg et al., 1987; Pennington and Blair, 2011); suburban areas where houses are interspersed with  patches of forest (Rosenberg et al., 1987; Blewett and Marzluff, 2005); rural homesteads (Bohn et al., 1980); shelterbelts (Haas, 1997; Kindschy, 1998); Great Plains and western riparian woodlands (Braden, 1953; Verner and Boss, 1980; Hopkins et al., 1986; Knopf, 1986; Hunter et al., 1988; Sedgwick and Knopf, 1990; Knutson and Klass, 1997; Sedgwick, 1997; Miller et al., 2003); marshes surrounding bay lakes (Lee, 1987); shrub-steppe with ample grass (Parrish et al., 2005); Mediterranean oak savanna (Troetschler, 1976; Verner and Boss, 1980); pine-oak woodlands (Verner and Boss, 1980).\r\n\r\nThe species notably avoids native habitats far from development or other anthropogenic disturbance (Mills et al., 1989; Clary and Medin, 1991; Blair, 1996; Germaine et al., 1998; Hagar and Stern, 2001; Merola-Swartjes and DeLong, 2005; Bock et al., 2008). Also, starlings are rarely found in native shrublands (Walcheck, 1970; Bohn et al., 1980; Lee, 1987; Hunter et al., 1988; Clary and Medin, 1991; Berry and Bock, 1998; Germaine et al., 1998; Parrish et al., 2005).\r\n\r\nStarlings avoid forest interior and dense forest patches (Guth, 1978; Derleth et al., 1989; Robbins et al. 1989; Ingold, 1994; Wilson, 1994; Dobkin et al., 1995; Knutsona and Klass, 1997; Mancke and Gavin, 2000; Hagar and Stern, 2001; Aitken et al., 2002; Kalinowski and Johnson, 2010; Pennington and Blair, 2011), with reported distances to edge < ~15 m (Dobkin et al., 1995; Peterson and Gauthier, 1995; Aitken et al., 2002). However, in the winter, small (<5 ha) patches of open-understory forest\u2014surrounded by cropland, pasture, and scattered buildings\u2014are used as roost sites (Dolber et al., 1978)\r\n\r\nThe species\u2019 abundance has been declining in recent years, particularly in New England (Foster et al., 2002; Cadman, 2007; Rodenhouse et al., 2009; Broker, 2012).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bEUSTx", "ELCode": "ABPBT01010", "scientific_name": "Sturnus vulgaris", "ITIS_TSN": "179637", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103906", "common_name": "European Starling"}}
