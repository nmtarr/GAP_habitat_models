Also found through central Texas to southeast California. Its range in elevation extends from below sea level localities in Death Valley California up to 2200m (Conant and Collins 1998; Hammerson 1999; Lannoo 2005; Stebbins 2003). In Arizona, red-spotted toads can be found in the Lower Colorado River Desertscrub to Petran Montane Conifer Forest commonly near permanent or temporary water; washes, rocky creeks, and cattle tanks. Also found in springs and tinajas in rocky canyons. It is considered abundant at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and its tributaries (Brennan and Holycross 2009).\r\n\r\nHabitats include natural and artificial permanent water (Behler and King 1979). The preferred habitats of this species include arroyos, desert oases, streams, oak woodland, rocky canyons, and open grasslands and shrublands. Often found on the floodplains of rivers on rocks and crevices. Breeding occurs in temporary pools, springs, reservoirs, intermittent streams sometimes independently of rains in the Spring (Stebbins 2003). Found usually near springs, persistent pools among streams, seepages, and cattle tanks (Conant and Collins 1998). Other habitats include rocky streams, but also in well-drained soils of the Arizona Upland division of the Sonoran Desert Biotic Community mostly in south central Arizona (Bradford et al. 2003 in Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aRSTOx", "ELCode": "AAABB01120", "scientific_name": "Anaxyrus punctatus", "ITIS_TSN": "773527", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103152", "common_name": "Red-spotted Toad"}}
