After a gap in the distribution, populations are well established in southeastern Louisiana, the Gulf Coast, and southern Florida (Conant and Collins 1991; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Rossman et al. 1996). Powell and Henderson (1999) have reported occurrences of this species in the Bahamas, but may not necessarily represent established populations.\r\n\r\nThis species is common in creeks, low gradient water bodies, and shallow water pools. Also, forested, herbaceous, and scrub-shrub wetland (Natureserve.org). Migrations have been reported between aquatic edge habitat and hibernaculum which usually takes place on higher ground, ant mounds, and sometimes high on rocky slopes (Minton 1972; Natureserve.org).  Soil, fallen logs, and ground litter serve for burrowing. Other shelter is provided by muskrat lodges, underwater, and thick vegetation.\r\n\r\nPreferred habitats include marshes, lake shorelines, swamps, bogs, ponds, shallow slow streams, wet meadows, seasonally flooded prairies. Found also in hardwood hammocks in or near dense vegetative cover in sun-exposed areas along the edges of flowing or standing water. Preferentially found in low vegetation, rarely observed climbing into the tree canopy (Bishop and Farrell 1994; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Harding 1997; Rossman et al. 1996).\r\n\r\nNE\t-Usually found near dense vegetation such as clumps of grasses and shrubs near the edges of water bodies.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEARIx", "ELCode": "ARADB36120", "scientific_name": "Thamnophis sauritus", "ITIS_TSN": "174134", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103516", "common_name": "Eastern Ribbonsnake"}}
