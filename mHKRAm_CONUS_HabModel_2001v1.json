The population has declined by more than 80% in the last 30 years mostly due to habitat loss through fragmentation and degradation, and lack of natural disturbance by fire and other factors (Kelt 1988).\r\nHabitat comments from NatureServe:\r\n\"Early seral stages of the chaparral community; low and sparse vegetation; widely-scattered shrubs; medium-textured sandy loam: southern coastal scrub, coastal sage scrub, or coastal sand plains and stabilized dunes. Plant species in habitat include bush lupine, dune lupine, mock heather, coyote bush, California sagebrush, croton, buckwheat, phlox, and deerweed; plant roots provide support for burrows (Matthews and Moseley 1990).\"", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mHKRAm", "ELCode": "AMAFD03063", "scientific_name": "Dipodomys heermanni morroensis", "ITIS_TSN": "202360", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104260", "common_name": "Morro Bay Kangaroo Rat"}}
