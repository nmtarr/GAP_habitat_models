It inhabits everything from tidal marshes along the Carolina coast to alpine meadows above treeline in the northern Appalachian and Adirondack mountains of New England. However, it becomes less abundant at the southern limits of its range in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Best associated with moist, densely vegetated fields of grasses and sedges (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). It is less adapted to short-grass communities or actively managed fields that are maintained at short-grass levels. High-grass lowland and upland meadows and fields, pastures with areas of tall dense grasses and forbs, fresh and salt water marshes, and to a lesser extent open glades in woodlands are all used by this vole. Dense grassy areas in open woods, orchards and along roadsides are also well suited to the meadow vole. Meadow voles build above ground nest of grass and other available herbaceous vegetation and require tall, dense herbaceous cover to adequately conceal these structures (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe meadow vole has the widest distribution of any species of Microtus (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Reich 1981). This species occurs in the southwestern region in northern Utah, Colorado and central New Mexico (NatureServe). The meadow vole is found to be associated with moist habitats (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The meadow vole can be found grasslands, preferring moister areas, but may also be found in woodlands (Reich 1981). In mountainous areas, it requires moist to wet bog habitat with lush cover of grasses, forbs, rushes, or sedges  (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  On the plains, it is most common in marshy wetlands along riparian corridors (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). This species is limited to grass-sedge communities in the vicinity of permanent water (Findley et al. 1975). They inhabit relict marsh communities, and pockets of grass and sedge often around small springs (Findley et al. 1975). In New Mexico, meadow voles are found in Sangre de Cristos as high as 3,048m along the Rio la Junta (Findley et al. 1975). The few Utah specimens are from the valleys of the northern part of the state along the western front of the Wasatch Mountains (Durrant 1952). Home range seldom exceeds 0.25 acres (NatureServe).  Home ranges are about 160 to 3500 sq meters; individual territories are small, roughly 7 meters in diameter  (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Needs loose organic soils for extensive underground tunneling (NatureServe). Nests in these tunnels or under rocks or logs, and in self-constructed grassy clumps (NatureServe). Diet consists mainly of vegetable matter, such as grasses, roots and seeds (NatureServe). Findley et al. (1975) report specimens from 3,048m in New Mexico. In Utah, specimens have been found at elevations of 1,260m to 1,350m (Durrant 1952).  In Colorado, found from 914-2895m (CWSD).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mMEVOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF11010", "scientific_name": "Microtus pennsylvanicus", "ITIS_TSN": "180297", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103729", "common_name": "Meadow Vole"}}
