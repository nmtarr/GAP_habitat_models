In general, this species occupies early-successional habitats of forest margins and openings, thickets, brushy areas, scrub, woodland undergrowth, fencerows, and human altered habitats such as abandoned fields, regenerating forest clear-cuts, young pine plantations, and roadway and utility corridors (Palmer-ball 1996, NatureServe 2004).  It is often found in valleys (Simpson 1992) and along streams and the edges of swamps.  Eckerle & Thompson (2001) classify the chat as an 'open-canopy obligatory species, preferring open understory and brushy understory.'  It is always in habitats containing dense growth of shrubs and vines, especially tangles of blackberry (Fussell 1994) or other thorny shrubs (Dunn and Garrett 1997).  A few taller trees or snags are required in the habitat for song perches (Dunn and Garrett 1997).  Chats build their nests in a bush, vine, low tree, or patch of briars, 2-6 feet above the ground (Harrison 1975), or occasionally on the ground (Griscom and Sprunt 1957).  They forage low within thickets, sometimes on the ground (Dunn and Garrett 1997). \r\n\r\nNumerous studies in the East and South have found the species to prefer shrubby thickets, especially those that regenerate from clearcuts (Eckerle and Thompson 2001).  Regenerating evergreen and deciduous forests are both used.  It is absent from pine barrens and barrier islands of New Jersey and is rarely found along the immediate Gulf Coast (Eckerle and Thompson 2001).  Shrubby forest openings are used in West Virginia, even within spruce (Picea spp.; Eckerle and Thompson 2001).  In eastern Tennessee, the species is rare and has been found in areas with understories and dense overstories (Eckerle and Thompson 2001).  \r\n\r\nThe chat\u2019s distribution is largely confined to riparian and shrubby habitats in the West and frequently occurs in salt cedar (Eckerle and Thompson 2001).  In southern Arizona, they occupy dense mesquite (Prosopis spp.)-willow (Salix spp.) communities adjacent to ponds and rivers (Eckerle and Thompson 2001).  In Nevada, they are most numerous in brushy thickets along rivers and streams (Alcorn 1988) and also inhabit lowland and foothill riparian hillside shrublands.  They are common summer residents of dense mesquite-willow Baccharis and arrowhead communities along major rivers and at ponds in Arizona (Phillips et al. 1964).  In the Southern Rockies, chats occur along shrubby coulee areas of plains, oak, and mountain mahogany woodlands of foothills, shrubby overgrown pasturelands, brushy forest edges, and along alder and willow-lined creeks of the prairies (Johnsgard 1992).  Some individuals inhabit mountain shrub communities of Colorado, especially scrub oak and skunkbrush, as high as 2,439 m (Kingery 1998).  They are a common breeder in brushy areas, riparian shrublands, and wetlands throughout Utah (Eckerle and Thompson 2001; UDWR 2003). \r\n\r\nN.
