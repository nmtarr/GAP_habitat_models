Successfully introduced to Andros and New Providence Islands in the Bahamas (Conant and Collins 1998). \r\nThis species is also known to occur on barrier islands off the Atlantic Coast (Lannoo 2005). Also have been well established in northern Puerto Rico (Rios-Lopez and Joglar 1999).\r\n\r\nBreeding and adult habitat are considered the same (Lannoo 2005). Described as highly aquatic; can be found along the edges of marshes, lakes, water-lily prairies (or other floating vegetation), and cypress bays (Conant and Collins 1998). Breeding occurs in open waters, permanent freshwater lakes, brushy swamps, cypress ponds, roadside ditches, and overflowed riverbanks that contain emergent vegetation (Dundee and Rossmann 1989). Pig frogs are also found in wetlands possessing moderate salinity (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aPIGFx", "ELCode": "AAABH01110", "scientific_name": "Lithobates grylio", "ITIS_TSN": "775091", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102371", "common_name": "Pig Frog"}}
