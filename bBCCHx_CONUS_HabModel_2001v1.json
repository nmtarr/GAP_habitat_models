Also disturbed areas, such as old fields or suburban areas, where suitable nest sites are available with sufficient foliage to support adequate food for dependent offspring. Generally more common near edges of wooded areas, but can be found even in the middle of large wooded tracts. Chickadees are most often found within 75 m of forest boundaries and often move parallel to forest edges, which act as movement conduits (Desrochers and Fortin 2000). They show a preference for woodlot fragments that feature a large canopy of old trees (Grubb and Bronson 2001). Often found in, though not confined to, areas where birch (Betula sp.) or alder (Alnus sp.) trees occur; these softwood trees provide both food and nest sites (Mennill and Ratcliffe 2004) (quoted directly from Foote et al. 2010).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nSegregated by altitude both from the (higher) Mountain Chickadee in the western mountains and from the (lower) Carolina Chickadee in the Great Smokey Mtns. (Tennessee, N. Carolina), although Carolina replaces Black-capped on some mountaintops (Tanner 1952) (quoted directly from Foote et al. 2010).\r\n\r\nNortheast:\r\nPreference for hardwood forest differentiates P. atricapillus from P. hudsonicus who prefers coniferous forest habitats (Smith 1991). In Ontario, cavities are found most often in birch (50%), aspen (14%), and sugar maple (14%; Mennill and Ratcliffe 2004).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nPreference for hardwood forest differentiates P. atricapillus from P. rufescens who prefers coniferous forest habitats (Smith 1991). In interior British Columbia, most nest cavities are found in aspen (Martin et al. 2004).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) is a year round resident across north central Canada and Alaska south across the central US bordering nw. California, s. Oregon, ne. Nevada, s. Utah, central New Mexico, s. Pennsylvania, n. New Jersey, and in higher elevations of the Appalachian Mountains (Smith 1993). In Colorado, this chickadee is a common resident throughout the state, but is in its greatest abundance in the mountains between 1524 to 2745m (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998). In northeastern Nevada and throughout Utah, this species is a common resident (Hayward 1976, Ryser 1985). Confined to the higher, forested mountains of New Mexico (from 2,250m to timberline), most common east of the Rio Grande, from Santa Fe and Pecos northward (Ligon 1961).  Other records in New Mexico have been from 1,650m- 3,150m (year- 1924); most sightings are around 1,650m (Ligon 1961).\r\n\r\nThe Black-capped Chickadee occupies habitats in deciduous, coniferous, and mixed woodlands; parks and suburban areas; willow thickets; riparian lowland cottonwoods; and old fields (Andrews and Righter 1992, Smith 1993, Kingery 1998, UDWR 2000). In eastern Colorado, this species will breed in riparian forests and towns and in western Colorado; it breeds in foothill and montane riparian forests, aspen forests, and Gambel oak shrublands (Andrews and Righter 1992). Breeding may occur up to 11,500 ft. or near timberline. During the winter, it will abandon high elevation habitats and move to lower elevation riparian woodlands along streams (Hayward 1976, Andrews and Righter 1992). Wintering typically occurs below 8,000 ft. The chickadee nests in natural cavities dug by both sexes, but will also use old woodpecker holes, and bird boxes (NatureServe 2004). Since this species excavates their own cavities, a suitable nest tree has a firm outer shell and rotten inner core; old aspen trees and cottonwoods are perfect nesting trees (Kingery 1988).  \r\n\r\nThe data for the range in elevation is from the Colorado Wildlife Species Database (Schrupp and Cade 1989) and Ligon (1961).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBCCHx", "ELCode": "ABPAW01010", "scientific_name": "Poecile atricapillus", "ITIS_TSN": "554382", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105569", "common_name": "Black-capped Chickadee"}}
