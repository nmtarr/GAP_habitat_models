Populations are also well established in northern Florida (Conant and Collins 1991). Habitats of this region that are used by this species include riparian zones, forest woodland, and hardwood woodland. This species burrows in or using soil, leaf litter, and decaying logs, but also standing snag and hollow trees (Natureserve.org). Eggs are said to be laid in or under rotting logs, humus, stumps, or under rocks (Fitch 1954; Vogt 1981).\r\n\r\nHabitats also include a wide range of woodlands. Preferably humid, well drained, and with an abundant supply of vegetative cover. Some reports indicate a strong tie with patchy canopy and seasonally flooded lowlands (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999). This highly secretive species, spends prolonged periods of activity on the ground and periods of inactivity under cover, but is also know to climb trees. In Texas, this species is described as arboreal (Natureserve.org). In Canada, the preferred nesting sites were characterized by an abundance of decaying logs and high substrate humidity (Hecnar 1994 (as referenced by Natureserve.org).\r\n\r\nCover is primarily provided by ground litter, leaf detritus, and decaying logs.  Populated sites are often characterized by dense vegetation that may also have an important role in providing cover opportunities.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rCFLSx", "ELCode": "ARACH01050", "scientific_name": "Plestiodon fasciatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173959", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104988", "common_name": "Common Five-lined Skink"}}
