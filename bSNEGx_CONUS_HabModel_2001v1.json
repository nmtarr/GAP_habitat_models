It is a common breeder in Utah, but it leaves the state prior to winter; a breeder in the middle and lower Rio Grande and lower Pecos Valley; an uncommon migrant and summer resident at lower elevations and in mountain parks of Colorado; a rare to uncommon spring and fall migrant and summer resident in Colorado\u2019s western valleys, mountain parks, and on eastern plains; an occasional migrant in New Mexico; local breeder in northern and western parts of Nevada; a common Fall and Spring migrant in southern Nevada; year-round resident in the Colorado River Valley, Bitter Lake, Bosque del Apache NWR, and Salton Sea; and occurs during summer at Picacho Reservoir and elsewhere in the Southwestern lowlands as a frequent migrant (SWreGAP 2009). \r\n\r\nSnowy egrets inhabit reservoirs; ponds; grassy fresh, brackish, or saltwater marshes; wet meadows; and rivers, but they prefer marshes, lakes, and coastlines over other habitats (Parsons and Master 2000). Habitat preferences vary somewhat across their range.  In the Southeast, they prefer shallow estuarine sites for feeding including salt marsh pools, tidal channels, shallow bays, and mangroves (Parsons and Master 2000, Hamel 1992).\r\n\r\nMidwestern habitats identified by Parsons and Master (2000) include marshes in Ohio along Lake Erie, riverine swamps and flooded fields in Missouri, forests surrounding reservoirs in South Dakota, and riverine floodplains in Illinois.\r\n\r\nWestern habitats include: \u201cwillows along large rivers in Nevada; reservoirs, grassy marshes, and wet meadows in the Great Basin, Colorado, and Wyoming; inland lakes and canals in the Harney Basin in Oregon; irrigation channels, estuarine habitats, marshes, and river courses in California\u201d (Parsons and Master 2000).\r\n\r\nSnowy Egrets nest in mixed-species colonies placed in shrub or tree thickets on islands, lake margins, or in swamps near water (Hamel 1992).  White cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps are used in New Jersey as are habitats with \u201ccommon reed (Phragmites communis); woody vines like blackberry (Rubus allegheniensis), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), and grape (Vitis spp.); shrubs like southern arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), groundsel tree (Baccharis halimifolia), marsh elder (Iva frutescens), blueberries (Vaccinium spp.); and trees such as eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), black cherry (Prunus serotina), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), American holly (Ilex opaca), gray birch (Betula populifolia), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and black gum (Nyssa sylvatica)\u201d (Parsons and Master 2000).  Freshwater lakes and swamps are used in Florida (Parsons and Master 2000).  Dredge spoil islands, red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle), and tropical buttonwood (Conocarpus spp.) habitats on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts are often used as well (Parsons and Master 2000).\r\n\r\nSnowy Egrets forage in water that is < 20 cm deep within salt and freshwater marsh pools, tidal channels, swamps, coastal inlets, and lake edges, but they prefer brackish and saltwater habitats (Parsons and Master 2000).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, they occupy mangrove forests, saltwater lagoons, freshwater swamps, grassy ponds, temporary tidal pools, beaches, shallow reefs, flooded rice fields, wet meadows, lakes, tidal flats, sewage ponds, and along large rivers (Parsons and Master 2000).
