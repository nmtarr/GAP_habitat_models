Also found west to the Mississippi River in some localities in eastern Arkansas (Ernst et al. 1993).\r\n\r\nThis species can be found under surface cover in association with loose, damp soils. The eggs of this snake are laid under tree stumps, rotting logs, rocks, leaf litter, or sawdust piles (Collins 1982; Mount 1975). Therefore, it is commonly found around wetlands and farm fields. Also found in partially wooded areas of hardwood or pine, but also in hilly areas and flatwoods as well (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Dundee and Rossman 1989; Hulse et al. 2001; Palmer and Braswell 1995).\r\n\r\nSE\t-Found in hardwood, grasslands, and even suburban/orchard settings.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rEWSNx", "ELCode": "ARADB02010", "scientific_name": "Carphophis amoenus", "ITIS_TSN": "174161", "Global_SEQ_ID": "786550", "common_name": "Eastern Wormsnake"}}
