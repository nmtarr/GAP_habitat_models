Illinois chorus frogs were widespread prior to extensive modification in the vicinity of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers between the late 1800s and early 1900s (Lannoo 2005). This species is considered uncommon with a reported small number (less than 10) individuals calling per site (Herkert 1992; Brown and Rose 1988; Tucker and Philipp 1993). The Illinois chorus frog is listed as Threatened in Illinois, a Species of Special Concern in Arkansas, and Rare in Missouri (Lannoo 2005).\r\n\r\nThere is evidence of a strong association with sand prairies of Illinois, or at least have a requirement for sandy substrate (Brown and Brown 1973; Axtell and Haskell 1977). Significant amount of time is spent burrowed in areas without dense vegetation (Brown et al. 1972). Breeding habitat in Illinois are mainly flooded depressions in fields, but other flooded areas are also utilized (Brown and Rose 1988).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aILGRx", "ELCode": "AAABC05061", "scientific_name": "Pseudacris illinoensis", "ITIS_TSN": "662726", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102695", "common_name": "Illinois Chorus Frog"}}
