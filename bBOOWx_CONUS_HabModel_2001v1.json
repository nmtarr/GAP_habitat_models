Utilizes dense mixed and coniferous forests, thickets of alder, or stunted spruce, commonly in proximity to open grassy situations.  Muskeg bogs.  Nests in spruce-fir forests that are generally mature and multilayered in the Rockies.  Will use old woodpecker holes, natural cavities, and tree holes.  Sometimes nests in natural boxes (Nature Serve). In s. portions of North American range (Rocky Mountains, Blue Mountains, and Cascades), subalpine forests characterized by subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii); also transition forests within 100 m of this elevation (Palmer 1986, Hayward et al. 1987). Because of changes in life zones with latitude, an elevation range for this species cannot be specified for the entire w. U.S. In Idaho and Montana, 75% of breeding locations are above 1,580 m. In Idaho, nests in aspen and conifer forest; all natural nest sites have been in stands of mature or older forest. Foraging sites in Idaho include mature spruce-fir forest. In early spring, immediately following snow melt, these owls hunt clear-cuts and agricultural fields (Korpimaki 1988) (Hayward and Hayward 1993) (quoted directly from Hayward and Hayward 1993).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nIn the Southwest, this species breeds and winters in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico (Hayward and Hayward 1993, Kingery 1998).\r\nIn Colorado, the Boreal Owl occupies habitats above 2745m in mature forests of Engelmann Spruce, subalpine firs, lodgepole pine, and aspens (Palmer 1986, Hayward and Hayward 1993, Kingery 1998). They prefer mature forests interspersed with wet meadows or near streams or bogs (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998). Roosting sites are widely dispersed throughout the Boreal Owl\u2019s home range (Hayward and Hayward 1993). Individual owls typically roost in new areas daily (Hayward and Hayward 1993). Roosting sites in Colorado are located in coniferous trees at an average of 5m above the ground in trees with a diameter of 33cm (Hayward and Hayward 1993). Foraging sites are typically associated with roosting sites and occur in mature Spruce-fir forests (Hayward and Hayward 1993). These sites are often associated with streams and bogs because of these areas have good populations of rodents for foraging (Kingery 1998). They also forage in areas of clear-cuts and agricultural fields after spring thaw (Hayward and Hayward 1993). During the breeding season, the Boreal Owl will nest natural cavities in subalpine firs and Engelmann Spruce (Palmer 1986, Hayward and Hayward 1993). In addition, Boreal owls will nest in transition forest areas with 100m of subalpine firs and Engelmann Spruces (Palmer 1986, Hayward and Hayward 1993). The Boreal Owl is a year round resident in which winter and breeding habitats are the same, but these owls may shift concentration of activities to lower elevations during the winter (Hayward and Hayward 1993). The Boreal Owls average annual home range is 1528 ha (522-4119ha) according to an Idaho study and in a Colorado study annual average was 1395 and 1576 ha (Hayward and Hayward 1993, Kingery 1998). \r\nThe data for the range in elevation is from the Colorado Wildlife Species Database (Schrupp and Cade 1989) and from Hayward and Hayward (1993).\r\nForaging sites in Colorado include mature spruce-fir forest especially in winter. In early spring, immediately following snow melt, these owls hunt clear-cuts and agricultural fields (Korpimaki 1988) (Hayward and Hayward 1993).\r\n\r\nUpper Midwest:\r\nIn n. Minnesota and Michigan, old aspen and mixed-forest sites (Eckert and Savaloja 1979, Lane 1988). Minnesota nests located in old aspen clones intermixed with conifers (Eckert and Savaloja 1979, Lane 1988) (quoted directly from Hayward and Hayward 1993).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBOOWx", "ELCode": "ABNSB15010", "scientific_name": "Aegolius funereus", "ITIS_TSN": "177938", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105053", "common_name": "Boreal Owl"}}
