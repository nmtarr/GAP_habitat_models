Affected adversely by human population expansions and cutting of firewood in ponderosa pine forests (Andrews and Righter 1992). Uses cavities for roosting and breeding. In New Mexico, most common in ponderosa pine, including ponderosa-oak and ponderosa-douglas-fir forests (Kingery et al 2001).  Pine forest and woodland, less frequently in pinyon-juniper (NatureServe 2004). In summer, ranges as high as Engelmann spruce zone. For winter, species spreads out into riparian woods lining grassland streams (Johnsgard 1986). This species can be found in the following mountain ranges: Glass, White, Sangre de Cristo, Uinta, Douglas, Mogollan, Chuska, Jemez, Sandia, San Mateo, Gallinas, Jicarilla, Sacramento, Animas, Guadalupe, Sierra Grande, Mule, Rocky, Snake, Sheep, Spring, Irish.\r\nShows a strong and almost exclusive preference for long-needled pine forests. Range almost co-extensive with that of ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, and similar species. In Colorado, 93% of atlas observations occurred in coniferous forests, 70% of those in ponderosa pines; range in Colorado essentially coincides with that of ponderosa pine woodlands in the state (Jones 1998). In Mogollon Rim region of central Arizona, breeds and feeds in vast expanses of ponderosa pine and also in shallow snowmelt ravines that course through the pine forests; ravines contain white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Arizona white pine (Pinus strobiformis), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and an understory of maples (Acer sp.; CKG). In New Mexico, most common in ponderosa pine, including ponderosa-oak (Pinus ponderosa-Quercus sp.) and ponderosa\u2013Douglas fir forests (S. Williams pers. comm.)(quoted directly from Kingery et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Washington State, uses Douglas fir zones rarely, and then only those in or near ponderosa pines (Smith et al. 1997). In Summit Co., CO, a small group occupies a small section of lodgepole pine at the edge of an extensive lodgepole forest. In California mountains, favors open parklike forests of ponderosa and Jeffrey pines in Sierra Nevada (Gaines 1988), but also ranges to 3,050 m in open stands of large lodgepole pines in White Mtns. of California (Shuford and Metropulos 1996)(quoted directly from Kingery et al. 2001).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bPYNUx", "ELCode": "ABPAZ01030", "scientific_name": "Sitta pygmaea", "ITIS_TSN": "178788", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100063", "common_name": "Pygmy Nuthatch"}}
