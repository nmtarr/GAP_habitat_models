Suitable habitats for this species include: streams with vegetation along the shoreline, and rocky (north) or sandy (south) bottoms (Gibbons and Dorcas 2004); clean streams or marshes of open areas or woodlands (Ernst and Ernst 2003); small clear creeks with rocky or dandy bottoms, stream impoundments (Alabama; Mount 1975); woodland streams and cypress domes (Florida; Tennant 1997); exposed rocky river shorelines (Arkansas; Trauth et al. 2004); shallow rocky streams in agricultural, urban, and forested areas (Virginia; Mitchell 1994); shallow streams and rivers with plenty of sun, rocks, and overhanging shrubs and small trees (North Carolina; Palmer and Braswell 1995); unpolluted rocky woodland streams (Illinois; Phillips et al. 1999); small rocky streams in wooded areas or open pastures, swampy woods (Kentucky; Barbour 1971); clear, spring-fed streams with moderate to fast currents and rocky bottoms, in lowland hardwood forests and shrub-carr communities (Wisconsin; Vogt 1981). \r\n\r\nThis snake can be found areas slow-moving streams, ditches, canals, freshwater marshes, or the edges of ponds or lakes (Gibbons and Dorcas 2004; Harding 1997, Hulse et al. 2001; Mitchell 1994), but this species generally is uncommon or absent from these habitats (Minton 2001; Palmer and Braswell 1995). This snake basks on branches overhanging the water while sometimes travels on land away from water. Refuges include burrows, rocks, logs, or debris (Minton 2001).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rQUEEx", "ELCode": "ARADB27040", "scientific_name": "Regina septemvittata", "ITIS_TSN": "174125", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102448", "common_name": "Queensnake"}}
