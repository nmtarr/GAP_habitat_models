Most recent records for the Great Lakes region are clustered near the southern end of Lake Michigan (Cook County, Illinois; northwestern Indiana; and southwestern Michigan) and in Lucas County, Ohio (Toledo area) (Barbour 1971; Harding 1997). The range has historically included northeastern and central Illinois, most of Indiana and Ohio, north-central Kentucky, southern Michigan, western Pennsylvania, and extreme northeastern Missouri (Conant 1943). \r\n\r\n This snake can be found in habitats with ample debris on the ground surface; open grassy habitats may harbor populations that are relatively difficult to detect and observe (Minton 2001). The distribution of this snake is centered in urban areas, often in vacant lots associated with streams or wetlands; these are fragments of much larger populations that have been reduced by suburbanization and may now be rapidly reducing (Minton et al. 1983). Although, this species can be locally plentiful in inner city locations (Minton 2001).\r\n\r\n In general, the Kirtland's snake occurs in relict Prairie Peninsula habitats: prairie fens, wet meadows, lakes, wet prairies and associated open and wooded wetlands, seasonal marshes, open swamps, sparsely wooded hillsides, and the vicinity of ponds and sluggish creeks (Wilsmann and Sellers 1988).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rKISNx", "ELCode": "ARADB06010", "scientific_name": "Clonophis kirtlandii", "ITIS_TSN": "174216", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105161", "common_name": "Kirtland's Snake"}}
