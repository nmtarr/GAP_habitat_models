Deep leaf litter and humus layers of wooded areas are important habitat features.  However, B. carolinensis can utilize root mats of grassy or dense shrubby areas in more open habitats, such as grassy fields, bogs, meadows and tidal marshes (Webster et al. 1985).  The southern short-tailed shrew was formerly B. brevicauda.  They can be found in every available type of land habitat, although they are less common on high, dry areas with a scant cover of vegetation than they are in the woods or in moist lowlands.  Other habitats include mesic hammocks, bayheads, mesic flatwoods, sawgrass ecotone, mangrove ecotone, grassy drainage ditches (Layne 1984).  They make their own burrow systems or take over the burrows of microtines and moles.  Nest sites are probably under logs, stumps and other debris.  The normal home range of this species probably is about 50 yards in diameter and covers about 0.4 acres (Burt 1940).  Breeding occurs from spring to late summer.  Gestation probably lasts 21-30 days.  Litter size is 5-7 with 2-3 or more litters per year.  Few live as long as 2 years.
