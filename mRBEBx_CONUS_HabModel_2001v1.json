It is usually encountered in abandoned manmade structures but most frequently roosts in tree cavities adjacent to streams or other bodies of water or in caves and mines in upland locals (NatureServe 2013).  These roosts are in cavities in large, living Pignut hickory (MS), Shagbark hickory (MS), American beech (KY, MS, and TX), Sweetgum (MS, SC), and Southern magnolia (MS), Water tupelo (AK, LS, MS), Black tupelo (LS, MS), American Sycamore (MS), Eastern cottonwood (MS), White oak (MS), Overcup oak (MS), Swamp chestnut oak (MS), Water oak (MS), Cherrybark oak (MS), Willow oak (MS), and Bald cypress (GA, LS, MS, SC; Loeb et al. 2013).  They likely discriminate between trees based on physical characteristics rather than species; suitable roost trees are typically relatively tall with large d.b.h. within comparatively open stands close to water (Loeb et al. 2013).  They do not appear to prefer roost trees on the basis of their proximity to canopy gaps (Loeb et al. 2013).  Other documented roost sites include bridges, cisterns, wells, under tree bark, culverts, caves, attics, barn lofts, abandoned mines, hollow trees, crevices, open cisterns, silos, and the porch of an abandoned house (Loeb et al. 2011).  They are known to sometimes move between artificial structures and natural roosts (Loeb et al. 2013).  While nursery colonies in caves are rare, they are known to occur in caves in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee (NatureServe 2013).  Cliffs and canyon walls are used as short-term feeding roosts, where prey is dismantled and eaten (Loeb et al. 2013).\r\n\r\nC. rafinesquii appears to use multiple roosts; switching between them frequently but showing high fidelity toward forest patches where they are located (Loeb et al. 2011).  One study found movements between consecutive roosts to average 360 m, another found a mean distance of 234 m, and a third found these distances to range between 0.06 and 8.73 km (Loeb et al. 2013).  Roost use seems to be influenced by temperature, food availability, light levels, and breeding, among other things (Loeb et al. 2011, NatureServe 2013). \r\n\r\nDuring winter, Rafinesque\u2019s Big-eared Bats are known to roost at the entrances of caves in mountainous areas, in lowland areas, they roost in buildings or trees (NatureServe 2013).  In the southern portions of the range these bats often roost in buildings year round.  In Arkansas, they are known to use subterranean hand-dug wells in hardwood and pine-hardwood stands near small streams that are not adjacent to bottomland hardwood forests (Loeb et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nRafinesque\u2019s Big-eared Bats are generally found in forested areas with a substantial hardwood component, especially bottomland hardwood forests of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains.  Elsewhere, they are associated with hardwood forests near karst features (Loeb et al. 2013).  They exhibit a preference for forest age classes (old) and tree species that hollow readily (Loeb et al. 2013).  Sites along river systems and other permanent bodies of water nearby old growth forests are preferred.  Landscape and stand-level characteristics have less influence on the species than characteristics of individual trees (Loeb et al. 2013).  Roosts have been found in loblolly (Pinus taeda), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia)-willow oak (Q. phellos), and bald cypress-water tupelo-Carolina ash stands among others (Loeb et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nIn Florida, they are found in most forests associations including hardwood hammocks, cypress bays, and pine flatwoods.  Known roost locations include buildings, abandoned trailer homes, tree hollows, behind bark, caves, culverts, limestone grottos, and rock crevices (FL-GAP 2003).  \r\n\r\nIn Georgia, suitable habitat includes mature forest of bottomland and upland hardwoods, pine flatwoods and hardwood hammocks, although individuals are often captured foraging over young clearcuts (SE-GAP 2003).\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, silica mines, shallow caves, and rock shelters in sandstone formations of the Cumberland Plateau are used as roosting sites (NatureServe 2013).  They utilize mixed hardwood pine forests and woodlands.  In the Cumberlands, they utilize Upland Oak-Hickory environments generally avoiding Yellow Poplar and Beech-Maple areas (Menzel et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina, this bat is absent from the Piedmont but present in the Coastal Plains and mountains.  The absence of occurrence records for the Piedmont, however, may be due to a lack of sampling in the region (Loeb et al. 2013).  Many C. rafinesquii roosts have been found in old abandoned shacks and barns in wooded areas near permanent water bodies, often during summer (Webster et al. 1985). Other roosts have been found in the hollows, crevices and bark of trees, and in caves and mines (NatureServe 2013).  At Camp McKall, tree roosts were in bottomland hardwood forests while humanmade structures with roosts were in developed and cleared upland pine forest/savanna.\r\n\r\nRoosts in bridges and Nyssa aquatica and Magnolia grandiflora trees were reported in Louisiana (NatureServe 2013).  \r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, they are found in cisterns and wells rather than caves (NatureServe 2013).\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi, they are associated with mature bottomland hardwood forests, upland mixed woodlands, and upland pine forests where there are abandoned buildings (Loeb et al. 2011).  Martin et al. located roosts under bridges in a landscape with upland and lowland mixed hardwood-pine forest, upland mesic hardwood forest, bottomland hardwoods, bald cypress/tupelo swamps, and riparian corridors adjacent to pine-hardwood forests (Loeb et al. 2011).  Tree roosts in loblolly pine-hardwood stands have been found, and roosts in abandoned buildings surrounded by bottomland hardwood swamp forest, upland mixed hardwood forest, and one upland mixed hardwood-pine forest have been found (Loeb et al. 2011).  Four of the largest known roosts are in upland pine forests (Loeb et al. 2011).\r\n\r\nForaging habitat studies on this species are few, but the foraging habitat is primarily mature forest in both upland and lowland areas and adjacent open areas (Loeb et al. 2013).  Johnson and Lacky found foraging areas were closer to forested and herbaceous wetlands, upland deciduous forests, edges of lakes, and forested wetlands than expected and farther from field edges, forest edges, and fields (Loeb et al. 2011).  In North Carolina and Virginia, foraging habitat was mature hardwood floodplain forest; sites along permanent water bodies, especially rivers, are preferred (Clark 1987). In the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, where large contiguous tracts of mature bottomland hardwoods were common, most foraging activity of males occurred in young pine stands; only 9% of foraging areas were in bottomland hardwoods (Menzel et al. 2001).  Foraging areas were measured to be 137.4 ha in one study of C. rafinesquii (Loeb et al. 2013).  Generally, Corynorhinus bats forage along vertical and horizontal structures, such as tree canopies, forest-open edges, riparian corridors, cliff and canyon walls, and low to the ground in open areas (Loeb et al. 2013).  One individual was recorded traveling 4334 m from the nest in one night.  N.
