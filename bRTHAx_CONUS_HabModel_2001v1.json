They are not found in the Florida Keys (Robertson and Kushlan 1984).  Altitude does not seem to be restrictive to this species as long as they have tall trees to nest in (Ligon 1961).  \r\n\r\nHabitats used include deciduous and coniferous woodlands, grasslands, shrublands, deserts, agricultural fields, and urban areas (Janes 1984, Preston and Beane 2009).   Rarely found in large expanses of open habitat without trees, such as the central sections of the Great Plains, Great Basin, tundra, and non-forested wetlands), or in dense forest (Preston and Beane 2009).\r\n\r\nThey usually nest in deciduous or mixed woodlands, primarily uplands (Hamel 1992), in areas with large trees, forest edges, and an open canopy structure (Santana et al. 1986).  Nests are usually placed in tall trees within woodlots adjacent to open areas suitable for foraging but cliffs, saguaro cacti, transmission line towers, windmills, and other elevated, man-made structures are used as well (Rosenberg et al. 1991, Preston and Beane 2009).  When placed in trees, nests are usually in tall trees, those taller than the surrounding forest and often on a slope or hillside (Palmer 1988).  In the eastern U.S., they avoid dense canopy forests and single trees for nesting.  Rather, they prefer isolated forest stands.  However a study in Ohio found 10% of nests to be in dense forests (Preston and Beane 2009).  An open canopy is favored for both easy aerial access and for a commanding view (Palmer 1988).  Generally the nest is placed in the crotch, 20 to 90 feet above the ground (Ehrlich et al 1980, Harrison 1975, Potter et al 1980).  Average home range size was 4.24 squre km (Schoener 1968).  Using the 95% ellipse, the home range for females was between 18.67-23.43 square km, and for males it was between 10.67-24.65 square km (Andersen & Rongstad 1989).\r\n\r\nOpen habitats, such as prairies or plains with some high perches are preferred for foraging areas (Kaufman 1996), although red-tails forage in a mixture of forests and open country including scrub, plains, pastures, agricultural fields, urban parks, and broken woodlands (Preston and Beane 1992, Hamel 1992).   \r\n\r\nIn the Southeast, Red-tailed Hawks breed in mature woodlands, dense forests, woodlots, groves, or a clump of trees on farmland (Hamel 1992, Palmer 1988).  However, AOU (1983) reports that they rarely use dense forest.  \r\n\r\nIn the Midwest, nests are usually placed in open woodlots or at forest edges.  They forage in upland or lowland hardwoods, pastures, grasslands, and lowland pastures (Preston and Beane 2009).  In western Ohio, they are most dense and have the highest productivity in grazed, open canopy woodlots (Preston and Beane 2009).\r\n\r\nThey nest in urban areas in New York, New York and in parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.  However, densities are lower in urban areas than rural ones and urban nests are adjacent to suitable foraging habitat, such as parks (Preston and Beane 2009).  \r\n\r\nWooded uplands, cypress tree islands, Australian Pine shelterbelts, and residential areas are used for nesting and foraging in Florida (Preston and Beane 2009).  \r\n\r\nIn eastern Oregon, this species can be found in habitats dominated by bunchgrass (Agropyron spicatum and Festuca idahoensis) or sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) (Janes 1984).  \r\n\r\nIn the western U.S., Red-tailed Hawks can be found in habitats that provide open areas and elevated features suitable for perching or nest building.  Patchy woodlands, canyon-lands, riparian corridors, and agricultural lands are used (Preston and Beane 2009), and they are common in both riparian and agricultural areas, as well as in desert washes and the outskirts of towns (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  \r\n\r\nIn Wyoming, they can be found breeding near expansive sagebrush-steppe or agricultural areas on cliffs or in mixed conifer/deciduous woodlands on moderately steep slopes.  In the Bighorn Basin, patches of cottonwoods in riparian corridors are used for nesting as are trees planted in residential areas (Preston and Beane 2009).  \r\n\r\nHabitats used in Colorado include pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus spp.) woodlands, lowland riparian woodlands, upland deciduous and coniferous forest, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) woodlands, shortgrass prairie, and Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) woodlands near open country.  In the High Plains, Red-tailed Hawks are restricted to areas with narrow strips of riparian cottonwoods and shelterbelts and are absent from vast expanses of open grasslands without any trees (Preston and Beane 2009).  In central Colorado, they can be found in areas near cattle production, that is comprised of shortgrass pasture and alfalfa with scattered stands of natural and planted tree groves. These stands include ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and oak (Quercus spp.) on the uplands and Plains Cottonwood (Populus sargentii) and willow (Salix spp.) in the drainages (Gatz 1986).  \r\n\r\nIn the lower Colorado River Valley this species may nest in the few remaining cottonwood trees or retire to the peripheral deserts where saguaro cacti or rocky cliffs provide nest sites (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  In central Utah, this species can be found in agricultural lands, sagebrush-greasewood (Artemisia tridentata-Sarcobatus vermiculatus) desert, grassland/pasture, orchards, and riparian/lakeside woodlands (Fischer et al. 1984).  On the Kaibab Plateau, AZ, they nest in places with steep, north-facing slopes, broken canopies, and dense understories, and they forage in open areas within 645 m of nests.  They avoid overly grazed grasslands in SE Arizona.  In the Sonoran Desert, they use areas with fewer elevated structures (trees) than in other habitats that they occupy elsewhere and avoid densely vegetated areas (Preston and Beane 2009).  \r\n\r\nDuring winter, Red-tailed Hawks occupy grasslands, shrub-steppe, lowland pastures, open woods, stream corridors, agricultural, suburban, urban, and other open and semi-open habitats with scattered trees or other elevated perches.  They avoid the interiors of treeless grasslands and dense forests.   In the West, they are found in a diversity of mixed grassland, shrubland, wetland, woodland, cultivated lands, and semidesert habitats (Preston and Beane 2009).   In the lower Colorado River Valley, this species in highly visible in winter (Rosenberg et al. 1991).  \r\n\r\nN.
