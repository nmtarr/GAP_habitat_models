A few individuals may hibernate in some northern locales of NM over the winter, but most migrate to Mexico (Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003, Frey 2004,Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Zeveloff 1988).  T. brasiliensis is statewide in Arizona, though in winter it occurs in the southern part of the state and in fewer numbers (Hoffmeister 1986).  Tadarida has been considered a summer resident of Nevada; however, recent observations by M.J. O'Farrell suggest pockets of year-round residents in southern Nevada (Altenbach et al. 2002). \r\n\r\nMexican Free-tailed Bats form roosts that are sometimes extremely large; primarily in buildings, or other man-made structures such as culverts, bridges, mines and bat houses (Kiser 2004, FL-GAP 2003, NatureServe 2005). This species tends to form very large maternity colonies, of 100,000\u2019s to millions of individuals (Navo 2005).  Historically this species has been reported to use the hollows of mangrove and cypress trees (Wilkins 1989).  They also roost in rock fissures along cliffs (Hall 1995, Thompson et al. 1996, Altenbach et al. 2002, Adams 2003). \r\n\r\nThe types of roosting habitat available for such large collections of bats is a limiting factor of their overall distribution (Navo 2005).  Large colonies can accept caves with cool temperatures (e.g., 12-13 degrees C) if cave has high domed ceilings which trap their body heat [e.g., Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico] (Baldino 2005).  Large colonies require caves or mines with a large entrance (Baldino 2005).  Water is also very important (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  \r\n\r\nThis species\u2019 habitat associations are very broad because they travel long distances to foraging sites and feed up to high altitudes.  Individuals have been documented traveling distances over 80 km (NatureServe 2005, Wilson & Ruff 1999) and up to 2,987 meters in altitude (Adams 2003), but they usually forage around 30 m above ground (Zeiner et al. 1990).  The species sometimes feeds over water (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Ziener et al. (1990) stated that it uses all habitats found at or below mixed conifer forests of Sierra Nevadas in California.  However, they prefer open habitats, such as woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands.  A study that captured bats in Utah found 18% in desert scrub, 76% in riparian habitat, and 3% in ponderosa pine (Adams 2003).  These bats have been known to consume large numbers of agricultural pests (Wilson & Ruff 1999).  They occur in a wide variety of habitats including scrub-grassland, desertscrub, shortgrass plains, sactan grassland, dry and wet meadows, oak savannah and woodland, coniferous woodland, coniferous forest, swamp and riparian forests, scrub (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Oliver 2000, Adams 2003, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004), cottonwood, willow, aspen, pinyon-juniper, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, bristlecone pine, limber pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, western live oak, gray oak, emory oak, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, saltcedar, sycamore, rabbitbrush, winter-fat, broom snakeweed, sagebrush, creosotebush, fourwing saltbush, tarbush, ocotillo, bluestem, crested wheatgrass, sixweeks fescue, wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, redberry juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oak, shinnery oak scrub, cattail, Apache plume, mesquite, buffalograss, alkali sacaton, tobosa, galleta, and ricegrass (Hoffmeister 1986, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, Oliver 2000, Adams 2003).  \r\n\r\nThe elevation that has been reported for Arizona is 137-3,220m (Oliver 2000, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2004).
