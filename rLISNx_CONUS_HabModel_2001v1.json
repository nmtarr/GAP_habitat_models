Individuals are often observed in prairie hillsides, woodland edges, canyon bottoms, residential yards, abandoned trash dumps, and vacant city lots. Moist areas where this snake occurs include areas not strictly near a body of water or wetland (Collins 1993; Degenhardt et al. 1996; Ernst and Ernst 2003; Hammerson 1999; Johnson 2000; Phillips et al. 1999; Werler and Dixon 2000).\r\n\r\nUses rocks, trash, logs, and leaf litter as cover.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rLISNx", "ELCode": "ARADB38010", "scientific_name": "Tropidoclonion lineatum", "ITIS_TSN": "174293", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102309", "common_name": "Lined Snake"}}
