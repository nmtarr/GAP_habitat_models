This tern breeds in scattered locations throughout North America that include the prairie provinces of Canada, northern Great Plains, many northern states in the west, Great Lakes regions, and a few locations along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts (McNicholl et al. 2001).  It winters in southern California, from southern New Jersey to southern Georgia and Florida, along the Gulf Coast, Baja California, interior Mexico, and along the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula (McNicholl et al. 2001).  The Southwest Regional GAP breeding populations of Forster\u2019s Terns occur in central to eastern Colorado; northern, western, and central Nevada; and northern Utah (Kingery 1988 and McNicholl et al. 2001).  Forster\u2019s Terns migrate through the Southwest Regional GAP area. The species is fairly common during spring and fall migrations on the eastern plains of Colorado and rare to uncommon in the western valleys and mountain parks (Andrews and Righter 1992).  New Mexico classifies the Forster\u2019s Tern as a rare to uncommon transient during spring and fall migration statewide (Ligon 1961 and BISON-M).  In Arizona, this species is fairly common in the lower Colorado River valley and rare in other parts of the state (Phillips et al. 1964).  In Utah, they migrate throughout the state (UDWR).\r\n\r\nThe Forster\u2019s Tern is sometimes called the \u201cmarsh tern\u201d because of its affinity for breeding and foraging in or near marshes, but it is also often found on open lakes and reservoirs (Kingery 1998, McNicholl et al. 2001).  It is often found in deeper portions of freshwater, saltwater, or brackish marshes and wetlands with open water and large stands of island-like vegetation or large mats of floating vegetation (McNicholl et al. 2001).  They forage throughout the marshes in which they breed, and in saltwater, coastal areas, they typically forage in shallow water (< 1m) over flood-tide mudflats or in areas of calm water offering high visibility (McNicholl et al. 2001).  \r\n\r\nForster\u2019s Terns are colonial nesters, and they nest near open water in extensive emergent vegetation such as cattails (Typa spp.), sedges (Carex spp.), bulrushes (Scirpus spp.), water lilies (Nymphaea spp.), reed grass (Phragmites spp.), and arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.; Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998, and McNicholl et al. 2001).  Nests are unlined or lined scrapes in sand or mud or are placed atop floating mats of vegetation, muskrat lodges, or abandoned Western Grebe nests (Kingery 1998 and McNicholl et al. 2001).  Nesting colonies on cobblestone islands in Columbia River, WA placed their nests on the ground in or near scattered vegetation that included northern wormwood (Artemesia campestris), northern buckwheat (Eriogonum compositum) and Columbia River grindelia (Grindelia columbiana), lupines (Lupinus sp.), and mulberry (Morus alba).  Along the Atlantic Coast, they breed in marshy portions of beaches and estuarine areas, as well as on barrier islands.  In salt marshes and estuarine islands, they will place nests on windrows of vegetation, including cord grass (Spartina alterniflora, S. patens), dry eelgrass (Zostera marina), and sea oxeye (Boccichia frutescens; McNicholl et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nIn Iowa, this species has been noted only in marshes >20 ha (McNicholl et al. 2001).\r\n\r\nDuring winter and migration periods, the Forster\u2019s Tern inhabits many of the same habitats as it does during the breeding season and is associated with open waters of lakes, reservoirs, and streams (Kingery 1988, Andrews and Righter 1992, McNicholl et al. 2001).  Microhabitats for foraging include marshes, lakes, water channels, shallow waters over mudflats, and in other areas of calm water that offer high visibility (McNicholl et al. 2001).  Prey species in these microhabitats include flying insects (e.g. dragonflies, caddis flies), beetles, small fish, and many other arthropods (McNicholl et al. 2001).  N.
