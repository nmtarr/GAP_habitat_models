along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Texas to Cape Cod. Subspecies Centrata is restricted to brackish coastal waters found along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to northern Florida. In Florida, also occurs from the southern edge of Flager County north to the state boundary (Ashton and Ashton 1988; Ernst et al. 1994; Morreale 1992). Subspecies Littoralis also occurs on brackish coastal waters, except its distribution is restricted to the Gulf Coast along western Louisiana to western Texas (Ernst et al. 1994; Morreale 1992).\r\n\r\nThis species is known to burrow in or using soil. It burrows in mud during periods of prolonged inactivity (Ernst and Barbour 1972). Nests are usually in close proximity to water. Eggs are usually laid in sandy edges of marshes, offshore islands, sparsely and heavily vegetated dunes, but generally above the high tide mark (Feinberg and Burke 2003 (As referenced by Natureserve.org)). The hatchlings move to nearby terrestrial habitats that contain dense vegetation, as they may use this as cover (Lovich et al. 1991). Habitats include bays, herbaceous wetland, river mouths, tidal river, tidal flats, lagoons, coastal marshes, coves, estuaries, and barrier beaches. In general, this species is intolerant of long term exposure to freshwater or 100% salt water (Natureserve.org). Unsuitable habitat is characterized by shorelines close to urbanized areas or rocky upland habitat. During high tide, this species can move into grassy lowlands (Ashton and Ashton 1985).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rDBTEx", "ELCode": "ARAAD06010", "scientific_name": "Malaclemys terrapin", "ITIS_TSN": "173780", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103342", "common_name": "Diamond-backed Terrapin"}}
