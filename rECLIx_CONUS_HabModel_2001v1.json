Prefers desert shrublands, sagebrush, pinon-juniper woodlands, and forested and grassland riparian areas.  This species range includes south eastern Utah, southwest and southeast Colorado, central Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Also found northeast Sonora to Zacatecas and San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Altitude around 90-3000m (Stebbins 2003). Habitat of preference, such as limestone ledges and rock piles, were described to offer hiding opportunities (Conant and Collins 1998). The eastern collared lizard range is described as the largest of any of the collared lizards. In the United States, this species is distributed from Missouri, Arkansas, and eastern Colorado, Western Texas, most of New Mexico, and Arizona. In Mexico, it is found in eastern Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo L\u00e9on, northern Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, Durango, and Tamaulipas (Jones and Lovich 2009). The eastern collared lizard occurs in pinon/juniper, sagebrush, desert scrub, semi-desert and riparian areas, and prefers to bask on boulders located in open and sparsely vegetated areas (Jones and Lovich 2009). In Arizona, this species can be seen basking on large rocks in Arizona Upland Desertscrub and Great Basin Conifer Woodland (Brennan and Holycross 2009). In Colorado, it occurs south of the Arkansas River and southeast of the Roan Plateau at an approximate altitude of 2135 meters in the southeast and 2440 in the west. Populations of eastern collared lizards occur nearby heavily populated areas where a small portion of suitable habitats are encroached by rapid urbanization and agricultural development (Hammerson 1999). In New Mexico, this species is usually absent from sandy soils, flat plains, and areas without rocky outcrops or riparian zones within them. In New Mexico, this species ranges from 900 to 2750 meters (Degenhardt et al. 1996).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rECLIx", "ELCode": "ARACF04020", "scientific_name": "Crotaphytus collaris", "ITIS_TSN": "173912", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105653", "common_name": "Eastern Collared Lizard"}}
