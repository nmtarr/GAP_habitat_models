Their range now covers much of the eastern and western U.S.  In the East, House Finches are commonly found in urban and suburban habitats, especially near bird feeders (Ehrlich et al. 1988).  They are associated with habitats comprised of short grass areas with scattered trees and shrubs, such as those found in residential areas, parks, golf courses, and cemeteries. They avoid dense forests and agricultural areas except around some houses and barns (Nicholson 1997).  They usually place nests near shrubs or buildings in a small ornamental conifer with dense foliage, or on a horizontal branch of a pine, spruce, or palm tree, in a tangle of vines, in a hanging potted plant, patches of ivy on buildings, or on a ledge under the awning of a building, from 5 to 35 feet above the ground (Ehrlich et al. 1988, Hill 1993, Nicholson 1997). The nest may be built on top of an old nest of a House Finch or other species, and may be in close proximity to other nesting pairs (Nicholson 1997).  Other nest substrates are shrubs, cacti, holes in trees or walls, bird-houses, eaves of houses, billboards, and hanging plants (NatureServe 2003).\r\n\r\nHouse Finches occupy areas in the West that are similar to eastern habitat, but they also inhabit various undisturbed habitats including dry desert, desert grasslands, chaparral, oak savannah, riparian areas, and open coniferous forests (Hill 1993).  They are permanent residents of the Sandia Mountains of New Mexico where they are common in pinyon-juniper woodlands (Tatchl 1967).  They breed in eastern Colorado and northeast New Mexico where they are abundant in irrigated valleys, and will breed in open woods, river-bottom thickets, scrubby or desert vegetation, ranchlands, suburbs or towns.  In southeastern Arizona, they are found in riparian areas including those dominated by velvet ash (fraxinus velutina), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), big-tooth maple (Acer grandintatum), Arizona sycamore (Platanus wrightii), Arizona walnut (Juglans major) and willow (Salix spp.) (Monson and Phillips 1981).  They can be found in southern Nevada in areas of mesquite dunes (Prosopis pubescens) and mesquite bosques (Prosopis juliflora) (Alcorn 1988).\r\n  \r\nHouse Finches are non-migratory for the most part but some populations migrate to lower altitudes or latitudes (Hill 1993).  They winter in southeastern Arizona in desert grasslands and oak savannas (Bock and Bock 1998).  \r\n\r\nN.
