They tend to avoid dense forest, swamps, and marshes, but will use open, grassy or forb dominated forests.\r\nTowards the southern portion of their range, they inhabit montane \u2018islands\u2019, such as Sangre de Cristo Mountains, NM.  Zeiner et al. (2008) listed alpine dwarf-shrub, perennial grassland, wet meadows, subalpine conifer, and open stands of lodgepole pine forest as optimal habitat and open, grassy understories of mixed conifer, montane riparian, red fir, eastside pine, montane chaparral, sagebrush, bitterbrush, low sage, aspen, Jeffrey pine, and pinyon-juniper as other suitable habitats in California.\r\nHoary and Yellow-bellied Marmots appear to displace one another in areas of where their ranges overlap (e.g., Purcell and Flint Creek Ranges in Montana); Yellow-bellied Marmots occupy lower elevations while Hoary Marmots occupy high elevations.  In parts of northern Wyoming and southern Montana, Hoary Marmots are absent at the higher elevation sites and they are therefore occupied by Yellow-bellied Marmots. N.
