Swainson\u2019s hawk typically nests in scattered trees within these grassland, shrubland, or agricultural landscapes (e.g., along stream courses or in open woodlands) (England et al. 1997).\r\n\r\nMaximum elevation of 2750 m for Park County, CO (Bechard et al., 2010)", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bSWHAx", "ELCode": "ABNKC19070", "scientific_name": "Buteo swainsoni", "ITIS_TSN": "175367", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105571", "common_name": "Swainson's Hawk"}}
