The species uses cropland year-round, and it is especially common in grain stubble over the winter (Mendel and Peterson, 1983; Church and Porter, 1990). Other ungrazed, uncultivated grasslands, including roadsides are also commonly used (Mendel and Peterson, 1983; Allen, 1984; Nelson et al., 1990), as are shrub-steppe and savanna habitats (Yocom, 1943; Porter, 1955; Vander Haegen et al., 2000). Nesting and roosting often occur in shelterbelts, fencelines, roadsides, and other linear patches of shrubs or small trees (McCrow, 1980; Allen, 1984; Carroll, 1993; Carroll et al., 1995) but also occur in cultivated cropland (Yocom, 1943; Mendel and Peterson, 1983) as well as in semi-arid shrubs such as big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and greasewood (Porter, 1955).\r\n\r\nThe species is commonly found within close proximity to edges; specifically, McCrow (1980) determined that the species used the periphery of crop fields; in Weigand\u2019s (1977) study, 95% of observed individuals were within 35 m of an edge; and 89% of Mendel and Peterson's (1983) observations were within 70 m of an edge, with none being farther than 200 m. These edges generally consisted of cropland bordering shelterbelts or some other shrub or small tree clump.\r\n\r\nGray partridges are also known in areas far from agriculture (Weigand, 1980; Ratti and Giudice, 2001).\r\n\r\nP. perdix avoids wetlands (Gates, 1973; McCrow, 1980; Schulz, 1980; Samson, 1982; Carroll et al., 1995), extensive areas of dense brush (Allen, 1984), and areas around trees (Church and Porter, 1990; Carroll et al., 1995).\r\n\r\nProximity to surface water does not seem to be a vital component of gray partridge habitat, as it can derive sufficient water from succulent vegetation and insects (McCrow, 1982; Allen, 1984). While Porter (1955) indicated that the species was not found farther than 0.5 miles from surface water, he did not report the spatial frequency of water within his study area.\r\n\r\nThe species has been documented at elevations in excess of 2400 m in Utah (Behle, 1958) and 1550 m in Washington (Yocom, 1943).\r\n\r\nWhile no known studies have assessed the minimum patch size requirements for the gray partridge, based on consultation with experts on the species, Allen (1984) applied a 4 ha restriction to his model.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bGRAPx", "ELCode": "ABNLC01010", "scientific_name": "Perdix perdix", "ITIS_TSN": "175915", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106284", "common_name": "Gray Partridge"}}
