Also found in southeast Missouri, east Arkansas, and east Louisiana. Isolated populations occur in west Indiana and northeast West Virginia, and southwest Virginia. Reportedly absent from upland regions (Conant and Collins 1998). Cryptic habits have affected the accurate assessment of the distribution of this species (Lannoo 2005). Have been reportedly eliminated due to habitat loss (Klemens 1993; McCoy 1982).\r\n\r\nDistributed in the forested East and Southeast, but associated with sandy and loose soils similar to the habitat of spadefoot toads in the arid regions (Conant and Collins 1998). \r\nFrequents brushy, forested, and cultivated areas with loose, sandy, or gravelly soils (Behler and King 1979). Breeding occurs in both bottomland and upland temporary pools, flooded fields and roads, and ditches (Lannoo 2005). They produce schooling tadpoles that do not use cover (Lannoo 2005).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aEASPx", "ELCode": "AAABF01040", "scientific_name": "Scaphiopus holbrookii", "ITIS_TSN": "173426", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100521", "common_name": "Eastern Spadefoot"}}
