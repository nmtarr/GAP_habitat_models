In the Southeast black bears persist in habitats that contain nutrient rich seasonal foods, sufficient den habitat and which are sufficiently remote to protect them from human exploitation (Pelton 1986). Black bears use a variety of habitats in different stages of vegetation succession, due to the seasonality of their food sources. Foods of black bears have been shown to include ants and insect larvae and some meat during all seasons (Clapp 1990, Powell 1997), grasses, forbes and buds in the spring (Clapp 1990), squaw root and old acorns in early summer (Powell 1997), berries and fruits in the summer and fall and hard mast of acorns and nuts in the fall and early winter (Eagle and Pelton 1980, Pelton 1982, Clapp 1990). Mammals, including deer are a rare food source (Powell 1997). In the Fall bears rely on high nutrient food sources to store fat for the winter and for reproduction. These foods include soft mast species which fruit throughout the winter in upland habitats of the piedmont and coastal plain. Hard mast such as acorns and gum fruit from the Nyssa genus are important for reproduction in the fall (Maehr 1984, Clapp 1990, Dobey et al. 2002,). Habitat quality directly affects the reproductive success through its effects on pre- and post-natal nutrition (Rogers 1977, Elowe and Dodge 1989, Dobey et al. 2002). Bears in the south tend to exist in regions of remote pine plantation timberlands and bottomland swamps (Hellgren et.al 1993). In this habitat matrix black bears were reported to use riparian habitats (also associated with hardwood species) in greater proportion to their availability (Stratman et al. 2001). Oak-hickory and mixed hardwood-pine forests provide hard mast foods and were selected over pine forests by black bears in Arkansas (Clark et al. 1993). Early successional habitats such as clearcuts provide high densities of soft mast species and may be exploited by congregated bears that display little aggressive behavior (Powell 1997, Rogers 1987). Agricultural habitats are also exploited (Allen 1999, Beausoleil 1999). Black bears were observed to spend most time in plantation pine in the Okeefenokee Swamp, however scat analysis of diet revealed that bears were foraging on black gum. These results were explained by the fact that radio-tracking was done only during daylight hours and that bears were using pine as escape cover from hunters (Dobey et al. 2002). Bears forage in agricultural habitats adjacent to forest and may be able to exist soley on agricultural crops in highly fragmented forest, provided that they are not poached and there is a year round crop supply (Beausoleil 1999). These findings demonstrate the value of general forest cover to bear populations. Forest fragmentation and road density, in the southeast has been correlated with the absence of breeding black bears.  Researchers suggest that bears can persist in areas with a threshold of road density (Hellgren and Maehr 1993), but no range of density has been suggested. Low traffic volume, remote roads were selected by bears, likely due to the abundance of soft mast along road edges (Smith 1985, Garner 1986, Hellgren and Vaughn 1988, Hellgren et al. 1991). However in areas where bears are commonly hunted or poached, bears tend to avoid roads (Hamilton 1978, Carr and Pelton 1984). Low recruitment and high mortality were correlated with remote road density in Arizona (Mollohan and Lecount 1989). In protected areas high traffic volume roads were avoided (Garner 1986) and crossing was less frequent (Brody and Pelton 1989). Bears avoided habitats within 120 m of roads in Arkansas (Clark 1991). In Florida some black bear populations  were reduced by up to 8 % annually due to traffic collisions (Simek et. Al 2005). Illegal hunting efficiency can increase with road access (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). Evidence suggests that bears that cross heavily trafficked roads less frequently, may shift their home ranges to avoid intolerable road densities or may be obligated to cross roads more frequently than they would normally prefer, to access necessary food resources (Brody and Pelton 1989).  Forest fragmentation may act as a surrogate to road density for predicting the occurrence of bears. Rudis and Tansey (1995) showed that black bear population occurrence in the southeast correlated with counties containing more than 160 km2 of bottomland harwood, hydric woodland, or timberlands. In Florida annecdotal evidence suggests that the minimum unit of forested area that can be considered occupied bear range  is 100 square kilometers  (Maehr et. al 2001). The minimum size of public lands occupied by bears in Florida was 10km2 (Hellgren and Maehr 1993). Black bear home range size and use in the southeastern US depend on seasonal food abundance (Powell et al.,1997) and human activity along roads (Brody and Pelton 1989). Female black bear home range use depends in part on male defense of the most productive habitats (Jonkel and Cowan 1971) and avoidance of aggressive males due to the threat of infanticide (Powell et al. 1997, Rogers 1987). Where resources are limiting, black bears exhibit territorial behavior in the northern US (Rogers 1987, Samson 2001). However, habitats are generally more productive in the southeast and consequently female bear home ranges tend to overlap (Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Smith and Pelton 1990).  Average annual home range size for female bears in southeast Georgia in the Okefenokee Swamp have been estimated to be as high as 57.9 km2 for females with cubs and 95.8 km2 for solitary females, whereas solitary and with cub female home range sizes in the adjacent Osceola National Forest in Florida were less than half the size of solitary and with cub females in the Okefenokee (Dobey et al. 2005). Seasonal home ranges in north Georgia for females have been estimated at 8.9 to 13.8 km2 for summer, and 11.4 to 14 km2 during the fall, whereas male black bear home ranges were reported as 15  to 41.6 km2 for summer, and 12.9  to 24.4 km2 during the fall (Brody and Pelton 1989). The difference in home ranges between the north Georgia, the Okefenokee and Osceola bears is likely due to habitat productivity (Dobey et.all 2005). Bear habitats in the Okefenokee are interspersed with flooded areas within swamps, and thus food and shelter resources are more widely dispersed, necessitating exploitation of larger home ranges. In the Mississippi alluvial valley, a riparian environment in the southeastern US, males maintained annual home ranges averaging 68.5 km2 compared to 10.5 km2 for females (White 1996). Den habitat can be critical to cub survival and black bear reproductive rate. Bears using ground dens without sufficient cover tend to exhibit decreased survival and productivity (Johnson and Pelton 1981). Black bears in the southeastern US select den sites primarily in large trees when they are available (White 1996), or in rock crevices (Clark et al. 1998). Ground dens dug under slash and downed trees are used in areas of timber harvest (White 1996). Black bears in the southeast exhibit habitat selection on timber harvest lands. Female black bears in Arkansas selected immature and mature poletimber oak-hickory stands and avoided immature and mature sawtimber pine stands (Clark 1991), however during daylight hours, while bears are most likely resting, pine habitats were selected in the Okefenokee Swamp (Dobey et. al 2005). Clearcuts were selected by male and female black bears in North Carolina due to high abundance of soft mast species (Brody 1984). Clearcuts were not selected by female bears with cubs in Arkansas, potentially due to avoidance of males who defended the use of these habitats (Clark 1991).  \r\nModel parameters were based on the following findings. In North Carolina Beringer et al. (1990) reported maximum home range road density for highwaysas 0.5 km/km2. For gravel and paved roads density was 0.7 km/km2 and  restricted remote forest road density was 1.6 km/km2l. Mykytka and Pelton (1990) report maximum road densities for paved and graded roads in Florida, within the composite home range as 0.68 Km/km2. The minimum size of public lands occupied by bears in Florida was 10km2 (Helgren and Maehr 1993). This also corresponds to the range of the smallest average MCP home range sizes reported for females in the southeast (White 1996,  Garshelis and Pelton 1981, Smith and Pelton 1989). A road density mask of 0.7 km/km2 was used for a moving window size of 100,000 ha. Windows with 800 ha. of habitat will be classed as having potential black bear occurrence. Habitat is considered to be all selected forest Mus, clear cuts, and agricultural areas within 300m of forest. The distance to forest was based on an assumption for escape cover and from bear location data from GPS collared males in central Georgia (Cook et al. unpublished data), where maximum distance to forest was 300m which represented less than 5% of locations.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mABBEf", "ELCode": "AMAJB01011", "scientific_name": "Ursus americanus floridanus", "ITIS_TSN": "726978", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103279", "common_name": "Florida Black Bear"}}
