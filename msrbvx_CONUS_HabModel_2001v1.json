In the West, habitats include forests of ponderosa pine, red and white cedar, hemlock, spruce, Douglas fir, and spruce-fir, grassy meadows, chapparal, willow-grass-sedge, rockslides, and krummholz (Williams 1955, Negus and Findley 1959, Hoffman 1960, Rickard 1960, Pattie and Veerbeek 1967, Clark 1973, Armstrong 1977). In the Midwest, C. gapperi occupies coniferous forests o f pine, cedar, spruce, balsam fir, hemlock, and tamarack, deciduous forest of maple, basswood, oak, aspen, and birch, mixed hardwoods, and thick brush (Manville 1949, Gunderson 1962, Beer et al. 1954, Iverson et al. 1967).\r\n\r\nSoutheast/Northeast:\r\nThis species is quite abundant in cool, moist montane forests of the southern Appalachians, typically at elevations above 3400ft (Linzey and Linzey 1971). High elevation montane boreal forests of coniferous spruce and fir trees and the ecotone areas where these boreal forests mix with northern hardwood (birch, beech and maple trees) forests are the haunts of this species (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Upper-mid elevation hemlock forests and bogs, where sphagnum moss dominates as ground cover, are also used to a great extent (Brown 1997, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Moss-covered rocky or heavy log-fall areas, or damp slopes, densely shaded with evergreen shrubs (rhododendron) within these forest types appear to contain the highest population densities. They are also found in grassy woodlands and grassy mountain meadows and heath balds (Linzey and Linzey 1971, Webster et al. 1985). At lower-mid mountain elevations, some bogs and other cool wet forested situations, such as rich cove forests and densely vegetated creeks, are occasionally used as well (Linzey and Linzey 1971, Lee et al. 1982). It has also been reported in cut areas with brush piles and debris (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). They construct nests of grass, leaves and moss in shallow burrows or rock crevices (Lowman 1975). Merritt (1981) states, \"Suitable habitats in eastern United States include forests, cut-over woodlots, forest-edge communities, marsh-grass, stone walls, old fields, and sedge and chelone communities.\"\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nC. gapperi is a resident of cool mesic sites within spruce-fir forests and is regarded as an ecological indicator of old-growth conditions in the Rocky Mountains (Thompson et al. 1996, NatureServe 2004).  It is unable to colonize pioneer plant communities (Thompson et al. 1996). It is sometimes found in grassy meadows, willow-grass-sedge communities, muskegs, sedge marshes, spruce and fir bogs, shrubby habitats, treed peatlands, willow riparians areas, talus, rocky ridges, krummholz, tundra, and even rockslides (Merritt 1981, Thompson et al. 1996, NatureServe 2004, Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  The species is often found in ponderosa pine and spruce-fir forests usually where there are rocks or rocky slopes, mature lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, bristlecone pine, limber pine, dense groves of Engelmann's spruce and corkbark fir, aspens, red and white cedar, and hemlock (Bailey 1971, Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, NatureServe 2004). C. gapperi often uses chickaree middens for cover and food (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  It also eats mosses, berries, lichens, and ferns, and in summer and fall the fungus Endogone is an important food (Zeveloff 1988).  The species drinks more water than other small rodents, which may favor in their selection of mesic sites (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It must have available drinking water (Thompson et al. 1996). The home range size varies from 0.01 to 0.5 hectares (Merritt 1981, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The elevation is from 1,768 to 3,201m (Durrant 1952, Merritt 1981). C. gapperi occurs in southeastern Arizona in the White Mountains (Cockrum 1960, Hoffmeister 1986). It is found throughout the mountains of western Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is present in the Jemez, San Juan, and Sangre de Cristo mountains of northern New Mexico, and also in the Magdalena and San Mateo mountains and the Mogollon Plateau in the southwest (Findley 1975, Frey 2004). The species occurs in the mountains of northeastern Utah (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997). Can be found in the following mountain ranges: White Mountains; Blue Range; Mogollon Mountains; Jemez Mountains; Sangre de Christo Mountains; San Mateo Mountains; Magdalena Mountains; Taos Mountains.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSRBVx", "ELCode": "AMAFF09020", "scientific_name": "Myodes gapperi", "ITIS_TSN": "180294", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105153", "common_name": "Southern Red-backed Vole"}}
