Their inhabit much of the Northeast and Midwest as well as the s. Appalachians and western mountain ranges.  In Among the locations of known southwestern populations are northeast, central, southwest, and southeast mountains of Utah (Durrant 1952), the Kaibab Plateau, the Mogollon Plateau, the Wasatch Plateau, and on several mountains: Manzano Mountains, Pinaleno Mountains, Sacramento Mountains, San Juan Mountains, Sangre de Cristo, San Francisco, White, Mogollon, Chuska, Jemez, Zuni, Mt. Taylor, San Mateo, Wasatch, Taos Mountains, Capitan Mountains, Black Range, Lukachukai Mountains, Tunitcha Mountains, Mimbres Mountains, Gallinas, Blue Range, Mt. Thomas, Pecos Mountains, Elk Mountain, Abajo Mountains, Uinta Mountains, and La Sal Mountain. A report of the species in the Zuni Mountains may be incorrect (Frey 2004).  Arizona, it occurs along the Mogollon Rim, on the Kaibab Plateau, in northeast Apache County, and in the Pinaleno (Graham) Mountains (Hoffmeister 1986).  It occurs in the western half of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994), and is found in the mountains of the western two-thirds of New Mexico (Findley 1975, Frey 2004).  In North Dakota, they are restricted to the Black Hills and they are not found in KS or NE (Koprowski 2005).\r\n\tThe Mt. Graham Red Squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis) is an Endangered subspecies of Red Squirrel that only occurs in the Pinaleno mountains of AZ (USFWS 2011).  They once ranged east to Turkey Flat and west to West Peak, but now only as far west as Clark Peak.  Historically found in mature and old-growth high-elevation, closed-canopy, mixed conifer and spruce-fir forests, most individuals currently inhabit mixed-conifer forests.  Their population has been declining due to insect outbreaks, wildfires, and fire suppression.  Middens have been found up to 3,268 m and as low as 2,353 m, but they are believed to have historically resided above 2,425 m.  A habitat suitability model was built for this subspecies and it associated the species with mixed conifer forests, ecotones, and spruce-fir forests above 2,744m or above 2,353 on north or east aspect slopes with less than a 45-degree slope (USFWS 2011).\r\n\tConifer seeds are a major component of Red Squirrel\u2019s diets, and suitable habitat is frequently associated with the presence of coniferous trees.  They have been noted as being particularly abundant where there are spruce and hemlock trees (Webster et al. 1985; Linzey and Linzey 1971).  However, forest type may not be as important to the squirrel as the availability of food and shelter.  They are present in most coniferous forest types from high elevation spruce-fir and lodgepole pine to low elevation ponderosa pine, jack pine, and pinyon pine (Koprowski 2005, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  They can also occur in deciduous forests in New England and north-central states where they feed on any nuts and seeds available, buds, leaves, bark, and tree flowers (Godin 1977, Jones and Birney 1988).  They also inhabit mixed riparian forests with aspen and cottonwoods, open forests, second growth forests, urban development, suburban parklands, mixed and northern hardwood forests at high elevations in the southern Appalachians (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), mixed coniferous forests (Thompson et al. 1996), riparian cottonwood or blue spruce stands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996), alpine fir and yellow pine, hemlock groves, larch swamp, and pine-cedar-birch forests (Thompson et al. 1996).  Layne (1954) reported that Red Squirrels near Ithica NY inhabited beech-maple-hemlock forests; mixed hardwoods with scattered conifers; coniferous plantations; old orchards; hedgerows; park-like areas; and \u201cedificarian\u201d.  Their use of hedgerows and orchards was related to availability of food.  Commercial thinning of forests may reduce densities but does not exclude this species completely (Koprowski 2005).  The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish (2000) reported the species in oak mountain scrub and montane grassland.  Less desirable habitat includes ponderosa pine forests, Douglas-fir forests, planted Norway spruce (Picea abies) and red pine (Pinus resinosa; Steele 1998, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).   Abert\u2019s squirrels often displace red squirrels from ponderosa pine forests (Kaprowski 2005).\r\nRed Squirrels are associated with high elevation areas in the Southeast and West.  They occur above 500 m in the southern Appalachians (Steele 1998); above 2500 m in AZ and NM; above 1,800 m in CO and WY (Koprowski 2005).  Fitzgerald et al (1994) reported a range of 1,830-3,660 m.  In the San Francisco Peaks, they are found mainly above 2,591m in Engelmann spruce, corkbark fir, bristlecone pine and Douglas-fir (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).\r\nRed squirrels are very adaptable in establishing their shelters.  They use abandoned woodpecker cavities, holes in the ground or crevices in rocky places, or will build a nest of available materials (sticks, leaves or bark, or some combination thereof) in the crotch or branch of a tree (Hamilton 1964).  Old nests of crows and hawks are also used.  Activity outside the nest ceases when air temperatures fall below -32 degrees Celcius (Fitzgerald et al 1994).  Home range is 1-6 acres (NatureServe 2001).  Breeds March-April and June-July in Quebec. Gestation lasts 31-35 days (Lair 1985).  Some females produce 2 liters per year with an average littersize of 4-5.  Some females breed when less than one year old (Lair 1986). N.
