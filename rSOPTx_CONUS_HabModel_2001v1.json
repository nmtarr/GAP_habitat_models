Riparian habitats include forested wetland, scrub-shrub wetland, herbaceous wetland, and ephemeral pools (Natureserve.org). Typical sites include ponds, swamps, slow flowing water ways, marshes, meadows characterized by plenty of available basking sites, soft bottoms, and vast vegetative cover (Dundee and Rossman 1989).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rSOPTx", "ELCode": "ARAAD01012", "scientific_name": "Chrysemys dorsalis", "ITIS_TSN": "208623", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102353", "common_name": "Southern Painted Turtle"}}
