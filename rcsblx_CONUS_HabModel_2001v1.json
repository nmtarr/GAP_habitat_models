It also extends into the southernmost tip of Baja California, as well as northern Zacatecas, and some islands of the Pacific coast in the Gulf of California, Mexico (Stebbins 2003). Mahoney et al. (2003) has confirmed a well established occurrence of the common side-blotched lizard on Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands, while demonstrating a more recent dispersal on San Nicolas and Santa Cruz islands, California. This species occurs in sandy washes and arid to semi-arid habitats (Stebbins 2003). In Arizona, this species is found in the Lower Colorado River Desertscrub, interior chaparral, and plains grassland (Brennan and Holycross 2009). In the northwest, this species is known to occupy the semi arid parts of the region and can be commonly found in sparse juniper woodlands and also in open deserts (St. John 2002). Habitats of the common side-blotched lizard include the central valley of California, Great Basin, Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan regions. Commonly found in dunes, flatlands, bedrock, boulders, and rocky slopes (Jones and Lovich 2009).\r\n\r\nNW\t-Sparse juniper woodlands and open deserts (St. John 2002).\r\nSW-\tDesert, grassland/herbaceous, shrubland, chaparral, and conifer woodland (Stebbins 2003).
