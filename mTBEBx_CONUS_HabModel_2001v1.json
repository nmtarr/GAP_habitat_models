However, the five subspecies\u2019 exact distributions and zones of intergradation are not well understood. Populations appear to be declining and are sensitive to human disturbance in hibernacula (Thompson et al. 1996).  \r\nC. townsendii occurs throughout Arizona, though it is seldomly found in the desert mountains, and in winter it is south of the Mogollon Plateau and northwest Mohave County (Hoffmeister 1986, Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003). Corynorhinus is widespread in Arizona, although not considered common anywhere, and is least common in northeastern grasslands and southwestern desert areas (Hinman and Snow 2003). It is present in the western two-thirds of Colorado and the southeast (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003). The species occurs statewide in Nevada (Bat Conservation International 2002). It is probably present statewide in New Mexico, though it has not been recorded from east of the middle and lower Pecos River or much of the northwest (Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003, Frey 2004). It occurs statewide in Utah (Zeveloff 1988, Oliver 2000, Bat Conservation International 2002, Adams 2003).\r\n\r\nC. townsendii is found at elevations from near sea level to greater than 3,500m (Kunz and Martin 1982, Bradley 2000, Altenbach et al. 2002), but most common at lower elevations (Bogan and Chung-MacCoubrey 2005).  Reported from 550 to 7,520 feet (168 - 2,294 m) in Arizona, but most records are from above 3,000 feet (915m) (Hinman and Snow 2003).  It was reported throughout the Nevada, from low desert to high mountain habitats, between 210-3500 m (Altenbach et al. 2002).  The species hibernates in the San Juans above 3,049 m (Bogan and Chung-MacCoubrey 2005).  Piaggio et al. (2009) reported a maximum elevation of 3,188 m.\r\nThis species roosts in caves year around (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Primary roosts (frequently used) are typically deep, 'non-drafty' caves. Secondary roosts (used infrequently or only once) may be in shallow caves or rock crevices, which typically surround the primary roost cave but can be located as far away as the outer limits of the bat's nightly foraging forays. Both limestone and granitic fracture caves are used.  Limestone caves may be the only type used as nurseries (Webster et al. 1985).  The use of abandoned mines for both winter and summer roosting habitat is very well documented in Colorado for this species (Navo 2005). 30% of all captures at mines are Townsend's Big-eared Bats (Navo 2005).  Roost temperatures appear to be critical (Pierson et al. 1999). Relative humidity of hibernacula in Utah ranged from 46% to 64% (Oliver 2000). Hibernacula temperatures in Utah varied from -0.9 to 8 degrees Celcius (Oliver 2000). C. townsendii needs temperatures between -2 and 13 degrees Celcius when hibernating with temperatures below 10 degrees Celcius preferred (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  When hibernating, it may arouse and move further into the cave to stable temperatures if the temperature near the cave entrance drops below freezing (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  They hibernate mostly in the uplands and mountains from the vicinity of the Grand Canyon to the southeastern part of Arizona (Hinman and Snow 2003). They are active at temperatures between 11 and 22 degrees Celcius in New Mexico and Arizona (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  \r\nThe presence of C. townsendii is strongly correlated to the availability of caves or cave-like habitat, but it also uses abandoned buildings and rock crevices on cliffs (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  The presence of suitable shelter - caves, rock shelters, cliffs, canyons, lava tubes, or mines with appropriate stable temperature and humidity - is an important limiting factor (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000, NatureServe 2001, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2003, Findley 1975, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). \r\nPopulation concentrations occur in areas with substantial surface exposures of cavity forming rock (e.g.,limestone, sandstone, gypsum, or volcanic), and in old mining districts (i.e., distribution is geomorphically determined and is strongly correlated with the availability of caves or cave-like roosting habitat, e.g., old mines (Pierson et al. 1999).  \r\nC. townsendii is found in a variety of xeric to mesic habitats: scrub-grassland, desertscrub, semidesert shrublands, chaparral, saxicoline brush, tundra, open montane forests, spruce-fir, mixed hardwood-conifer, and oak woodlands and forests, Coniferous forests, mixed mesophytic forests, deserts, native prairies, riparian communities, active agricultural areas, coastal habitat types cottonwood and willow, western live oak, pinyon-juniper, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, bristlecone pine, limber pine, ponderosa pine, California redwood, Douglas-fir, white fir, gray oak, emory oak, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, tarbush, ocotillo, creosotebush, winter-fat, saltcedar, sagebrush, redwood, silverleaf and netleaf oak, shinnery oak scrub, rabbitbrush, bluestem, alkali sacaton, grama and buffalograss, wheatgrass, tobosa, galleta, ricegrass, sycamore, alder, apache plume, and mesquite (Hoffmeister 1986, Ports and Bradley 1996, Thompson et al. 1996, Oliver 2000, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2003). (Hoffmeister 1986, Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996, Arizona Game and Fish Department 2003).  In Nevada, it is primarily in rural settings in pinon-juniper-mahogany, white fir, blackbrush, sagebrush, salt desert scrub, and agricultural; but occasionally in urban habitats (Altenbach 2002).  In Colorado it is found among saxicoline brush, sage-brush, semidesert scrub, pinon-juniper woodlands, ponderosa pine woodlands, montane forest (Adams 2003).  In California, it is found throughout the state except in alpine and subalpine habitats (Zeiner et al. 1900). N.
