It inhabits a variety of habitats in a wide range of elevations.  The elevation range of this species distribution is remarkable because it covers many different environments, more than any other species in its genus.  It occurs from desert level elevation, nesting in the nearby mesquite up through oak, sweetgum, and pine-oak to 2,300 meters (NatureServe 2012).  Suitable habitats include hardwood and mixed forests; shrubland, chaparral, and woodlands that are evergreen, mixed, or deciduous; orchards; parks; suburban areas; temperate brushlands such as Tamaulipan thorn scrub and Piedmnot scrub; montane forest including Coahuila douglas-fir; montane mesic forest of east and southeastern Texas; Chisos Mountain pinyon\u2013juniper\u2013oak and cypress\u2013pine\u2013oak woodlands; mesquite shrublands; riparian woodlands containing oak (Quercus spp.) and mesquite (Prosopis spp.); gallery forest; secondary forests; tropical deciduous forest; arid to semi-humid oak and semi-deciduous woodlands; open areas with hedges and scattered trees; scrubby woodlands (Patten and Smith-Patten 2008, NatureServe 2012).\r\nLike the Tufted Titmouse, preferred habitats contain tall vegetation, numerous tree species, and dense canopy (Patten and Smith-Patten 2008).  Densities are high in Rio Grande valley riparian forest and open forest (Patten and Smith-Patten 2008).  N.
