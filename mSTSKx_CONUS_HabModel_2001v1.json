It is rather general in its habitat associations, occurring in ecosystems other than deep forest, desert, alpine tundra, or marsh (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Wilson and Ruff 1999, Brown 1997, Zeveloff 1988, Godin 1977).  Suitable habitats identified in the literature include cultivated fields, pastures, grasslands, brushy areas, semi-open woodlands, riparian and bottomland forests, suburban residential areas, rocky outcrops, woody ravines, and fencerows (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Zeveloff 1988, Jones and Barney 1988, Wilson and Ruff 1999).  They appear to prefer woodland edges and landscapes that are patchworks of woodland and open areas (Zeveloff 1988).  They will inhabit wooded river corridors in desert landscapes (Feldhamer et al. 2003).\r\n\r\nThey can be found in western mountains up to the treeline, but they are commonest at lower elevations, especially in and near cultivated fields and pastures (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).
