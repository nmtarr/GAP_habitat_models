All manner of aquatic habitats that can be dammed to form calm pools and ponds are used. They will readily occupy artificial ponds, reservoirs, and canals if food is available. In mountainous areas, beavers typically have the most success at building ponds in valleys and flattened areas. Therefore, populations are more apt to be concentrated at lower elevations (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998; Linzey and Linzey 1971). However, they can be found far up the tributaries of mountain streams (Webster et al. 1985). They generally avoid lakes with strong wave action, fast- moving streams, and greatly fluctuating flow or water levels. In larger rivers beavers use floodplains and backwaters. In the north, they require water that is deep enough such that it does not freeze to the bottom and allows the accumulation of a substantial food pile beneath the ice. Though populations are sporadically distributed, beavers can populate areas quickly and become locally common anywhere except in tidewater habitats (Lee et al. 1982, Webster et al. 1985). They were almost extirpated through trapping before 1900, but they were transplanted in the early 1940s and have increased dramatically. Beavers are noteworthy in their ability to modify their environment, perhaps creating suitable habitat patches for birds and other mammalian species. Beavers build lodges or use burrows in earthen banks (Webster et al. 1985). One or more families may occupy a pond. In the South breeding occurs late October-March and parturition generally occurs late March and early April (Wigley et al. 1983). Litter size ranges from one to nine (3-4 typical). Females normally first give birth on or near their third birthday and may remain productive for up to at least ten years (Stegeman 1954). In most cases, the young disperse from their family group in late winter or early spring at an age of almost two years, before the new kits are born. Dispersal occurs over land and via waterways (Leege 1968).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThis species needs an adequate supply of woody vegetation near a stream. It avoids seasonally fluctuating streams and fast-moving water, and does not prefer rocky streams or shorelines (Novak 1987). In Arizona it lives in continuously flowing waterways, even canals and small streams or streams with limited flow of water if vegetation is suitable (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). It utilizes irrigation canals (Frey 2004). The species is found at the Colorado River where the temperature can be well over 120 degrees F (Hoffmeister 1986).  It occurs within a few hundred meters of water (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Plants eaten depend largely upon availability (Davis and Davis 1997).  C. canadensis eats birch, sweetgum, blackgum, bur-reed, duckweeds, pondweeds, clover, alfalfa, corn, mesquite, cattail, and soybeans (Hoffmeister 1986, NatureServe 2001). The minimum territory is 0.4 ha, and the nearest neighbor minimum is 0.7 km (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The home range in Manitoba was 7.7 km (NatureServe 2001). Elevation is from 0-3400m (NatureServe 2001). It is found on slopes up to 15 degrees (Novak 1987). The beaver occurs in most of the major streams and mountain creeks in Arizona, though it is absent from the Santa Cruz River, most of the western part of the Gila River, most of the Little Colorado River, and part of the Salt River (Hoffmeister 1986). Historically it occurred in the San Pedro River, but is now extirpated (Frey 2004). It is found throughout Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). The species occurs in northern Nevada and along the Colorado River (Hall 1995). It occurs in New Mexico in the drainages of the Canadian River, Colorado River, Rio Grande, and Pecos River (Frey 2004). It occurs throughout Utah in slow moving permanent streams, rivers, small lakes, and reservoirs (Utah GAP 1997). Found in the San Juan Mountains, Sangre de Cristo, San Francisco Mountains, White Mountains, Mogollon Mountains, Chuska Mountains, Jemez Mountains, and Zuni Mountains.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mAMBEx", "ELCode": "AMAFE01010", "scientific_name": "Castor canadensis", "ITIS_TSN": "180212", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100922", "common_name": "American Beaver"}}
