It occupies bunchgrass plains, juniper/pine woodlands, and volcanic pumice sand openings in pine forests up to elevations of 1680-1830m (St. John 2002). Elevational range includes areas located around 300 up to 1830m (Stebbins 2003). Jones and Lovich (2009) describe the elevational range to include areas at 2200 meters. Found only in the United States, this lizard is found east of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon; into southern Idaho. It is also found in northeastern California and northwestern Nevada.
