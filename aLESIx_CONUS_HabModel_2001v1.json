It hides among plants and debris by day and burrows into bottom mud if water dries up. The eggs are laid in water in a small pocket or debris-covered cavity in bottom mud.\r\nFrom Lannoo (2005):  Shallow, warm, quiet water of ponds and sloughs where aquatic vegetation is plentiful (Smith and Minton, 1957). Permanent or semipermanent habitats, including marshes, swamps, farm ponds, ditches, canals, sloughs, and sluggish, vegetation-choked creeks (e.g., Neill, 1949b; see also Petranka, 1998). Temporary floodplain pools and shallow, heavily vegetated sections of ponds with deep sediments provide burrowing sites (Funderburg and Lee, 1967; Gehlbach and Kennedy, 1978). In areas of sympatry, lesser sirens and greater sirens (S. lacertina) are partitioned by habitat preferences\u2014lesser sirens tend to inhabit more acidic pH waters, while greater sirens are found in aquatic sites with circumneutral pH (P.E. Moler, personal communication, in McAllister et al., 1994). This appears to be consistent with Carr's (1940) observations in Florida that lesser sirens are characteristic of pine flatwoods ponds and bayheads (a normally acidic environment), while greater sirens are characteristic of sloughs, canals, and drainage ditches, and frequent in lakes. Lesser sirens are restricted to wetlands that hold water for at least 6 mo (Snodgrass et al., 1999).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nLesser sirens inhabit a variety of permanent or semi-permanent habitats such as shallow water in swamps or weedy ponds, Carolina Bays, ditches, pools, lakes, marshes, and canals. They are sometimes found in rivers and streams (Martof 1973). They occur in cypress and pinewoods (Bishop 1947 and Carr and Goin 1955).  Lesser sirens require a microhabitat with bottom debris and aquatic vegetation. They withstand dry periods by burrowing into and encapsulating in mud.  They are capable of limited overland movement between water bodies. In South Carolina, oviposition occurs during February-April. Fertilization is evidently is external (Sever et al. 1996). They lay a clutch averaging 200 eggs in winter (e.g., in Louisiana, Raymond 1991) or early spring in a small pocket or debris-covered cavity in bottom mud. The female guards the eggs. Sexually maturity is reached in 2 years. They are paedomorphic.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aLESIx", "ELCode": "AAAAG02010", "scientific_name": "Siren intermedia", "ITIS_TSN": "173736", "Global_SEQ_ID": "102332", "common_name": "Lesser Siren"}}
