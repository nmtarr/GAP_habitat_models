In New Mexico, this species is considered casual in the Big Hatchet Mountains (Hidalgo County) and has been reported in the Pinos Altos Mountains (Grant County; Sullivan 1999).\r\n\r\nYellow-eyed Juncos have seasonal habitat requirements.  Primarily, they use pine-oak woodlands to mixed conifer forests during summer.  Breeding season vegetation is described as Transition and Boreal Zones (Monson and Phillips 1981), which is identified as open mixed coniferous forest and pine-oak woodlands with adjacent open meadows, pastures, fields, and scrub- and brush-lands (Sullivan 1999).  In the Chiricahua and Pinale\u00f1os Mountains of southeastern Arizona, breeding habitat is characterized as open coniferous forests usually containing a mosaic of large conifer species (ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa] and Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii]) with open flat or sloped areas covered with grass (Moore 1972), bracken fern and/ or wildflowers, and shrubby and brushy areas (Sullivan 1999).  In the Chiricahua Mountains, it is \u201cabundant\u201d in coniferous forests (n = 10 nests; Ligon and Balda 1968).  Marshall (1957) asserts Yellow-eyed juncos require tall coniferous trees with open leaf-strewn ground beneath.  Though Sullivan (1999) identifies this species as occurring within pine-oak woodlands, this species was not observed within pine-oak woodlands on the Pinale\u00f1os Mountains (JJW).  Marshall (1957) believed its occurrence was due to adjacent stands of mixed coniferous trees.  Marshall (1956), in the Rincon Mountains, identified this species as occurring from pine-oak woodlands to pine and fir forests.  We do not know whether either or both of Marshall\u2019s accounts reflected seasonality.  \r\nDuring the breeding season, it forages on ground and in trees and shrubs; often avoids patches of sunlight, which may serve to reduce predation risk (Sullivan 1999), suggesting this species may select for high foliage cover.  Breeding Yellow-eyed Juncos roost singly at night in the tops of large pines (Moore 1972).  When establishing and/ or retaining territory or attempting to attract a mate, males often sing from atop prominent trees in territory (Howell and Webb 1995, Sullivan 1999).  Average territory size is 0.7ha (Moore 1972).\r\n\r\nNests are constructed on sloping ground (14 of 25 nests) with nest opening facing down slope (Sullivan 1999).  Nest is generally shaded receiving 0-35 % incident radiation (mean 18, n = 8; Sullivan 1999).  In Arizona, 23 of 27 nests were located either on level ground or hillside beneath Muhlenbergia sp. Grass 0.5 to 1.5m high (Moore 1972).  Nests are rarely located in tree cavities, but may occur in conifers to 30 m nest height, woven into bracken fern fronds and on human structures (Sullivan 1999).  Aspect of nest entrance on level ground seems random, though those on an incline face downslope (Moore 1972).\r\n\r\nWinter habitat occurs at the lower elevations and is characterized as Upper Sonoran Lifezone (Monson and Phillips 1981).  Vegetation containing high grass and shrub cover is selected with higher frequency; more time is spent foraging when adequate cover is available (Sullivan 1999).  \r\n\r\nThis species is known to migrate down slope on Madrean sky islands into shrub vegetation.  In Arizona, breeding habitat of this species occurs from 1,200 to 3,500 m elevation, but usually occurs above 2,000 m elevation (Sullivan 1999).  In the Huachuca Mountains, Swarth (1904) suggests this species is most abundant above (2,280m) 7,500 ft elevation.  In canyons of the Santa Rita Mountains, this species occurs =1,500m (4,900ft) elevation (Bailey 1923).  In the Huachuca Mountains, during the winter yellow-eyed juncos are rarely observed below 1,700 m (5,500 ft) elevation (Swarth 1904).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bYEJUx", "ELCode": "ABPBXA5030", "scientific_name": "Junco phaeonotus", "ITIS_TSN": "179427", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101400", "common_name": "Yellow-eyed Junco"}}
