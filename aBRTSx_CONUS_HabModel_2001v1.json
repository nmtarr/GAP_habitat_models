Adults may be found in and around rocky brooks, springs, and seepages during the breeding season.  After breeding, adults migrate into surrounding mesic deciduous or mixed forests and spend most of the year underground.  Eggs are laid in water on the undersides of rocks, logs, etc.  In southwestern North Carolina, eggs are laid in late winter and early spring.  The average clutch size is 28-56.  The female stays with eggs until the eggs hatch in late June-early July.  Larvae metamorphose in 1-2 years (in 1 year in warmer first-order streams, in 1-2 years in cooler higher-order streams; (Voss 1993).  The average age at first reproduction is 3-4 years, usually the latter (Bruce 1985).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aBRTSx", "ELCode": "AAAAD05150", "scientific_name": "Eurycea wilderae", "ITIS_TSN": "550248", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106042", "common_name": "Blue Ridge Two-lined Salamander"}}
