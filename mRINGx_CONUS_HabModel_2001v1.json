It is secure in Arizona, apparently Secure in New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and vulnerable in Utah.  It is typically found in rocky areas with cliffs or crevices for daytime shelter, desert scrub, chaparral, pine-oak and conifer woodlands (Hall 1995).  They are found in dry habitats from sea level to 2,900 meters but seldom more than 1/4 mile from a water source (Frey 1996).  In the Southwest, they mainly live in Upper Sonoran Zone but are often found in brushy canyons that extend into the valleys of the lower Sonoran Zone. In summer, they are found in Transition Zone (Fitzgerald et al. 1994).  They are found in dry habitats from sea level to 2,900 meters but seldom more than 1/4 mile from a water source (Frey 1996).  Ringtails are inhabitants of rocky or broken country from the desert into the lower forest zones (NatureServe 2001).  Ringtails generally live in areas of rock exposures, commonly in rock canyons below 1,800 m (Olin 1988).  Rocky areas are common throughout New Mexico and include lava flows, talus, and escarpments. Vegetation in these areas may be sparse. Ringtail is associated with certain of these habitats. Many of New Mexico's rock adapted species of mammals may be found in low altitude lava flows and at high altitude talus slopes but are often absent at intermediate altitudes that lack these habitats (Cockrum and Petryszyn 1992).  They are fairly common in Colorado, ranging just into southwest corner of Wyoming and are typically associated with rocky canyon country and foothills areas of pinon-juniper woodlands, montane shrublands, or mixed conifer-oakland (Holling 1992).  In California, Ringtails inhabit most types of shrublands and woodlands at low and middle elevations (max elevation 2,600 m; Jameson and Peeters 2004).  They appear to favor areas near creeks and rivers and are found in the Sacramento Valley in foothill canyons (Jameson and Peeters 2004).  In Texas, they are common in rocky, brush of the Edwards Plateau and Trans-pecos regions, and in wooded areas of the Cross Timbers region (Schmidly 2004).  Little information is available on their distribution and relative abundance among habitats (Grinnell et al. 1937, Schempf and White 1977).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mRINGx", "ELCode": "AMAJE01010", "scientific_name": "Bassariscus astutus", "ITIS_TSN": "180577", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105257", "common_name": "Ringtail"}}
