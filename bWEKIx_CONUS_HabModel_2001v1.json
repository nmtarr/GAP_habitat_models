Human presence in many of these habitats is often important. Structures such as telephone poles and fences and also planted shade trees make some habitats more suitable (Gamble and Bergin 1996). Prefers open to partly open country, savanna, agricultural lands, and areas with scattered trees. Prefers desert habitat; also in open riparian areas with tall trees (AOU 1983). Occurs in southeastern Arizona, and this is at the southern limits of its range. While the species chosen for nesting does not appear to be important, the height of the chosen plant is. While this species prefers open savanna-like areas, it will always choose a tree over a shrub when a tree is available. They will nest in yuccas if there are no trees.  This species will occur sympatrically with T. vociferans in southern Arizona, north to Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada. This species can be found in southeastern Arizona in riparian forests, with vegetation characterized by sycamore trees (Plantanus wrightii), open riparian areas, also characterized by P. wrightii, dry creek washes, characterized by willow (Salix spp.) and hackberry (Celtis reticulata) and deserts, characterized by creosote (Larrea tridentata), century plants (Agave spp.), and ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens). Many of the kingbird nest sites in Arizona were found in yucca-pastureland associations (Blancher and Robertson 1984). Often associated with prairie dog towns of juniper (Juniperus monosperma) and cholla (Opuntia imbricata) (Blancher and Robertson 1984). Also associated with sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) in prairie dog towns (Clark et al. 1982). In California, the Western Kingbird is a common breeder in spring and summer in arid, unforested lowlands. The species breeds locally on the North Coast, but is more abundant in the drier interior. Inhabits open habitats: grasslands, croplands, and open shrublands. Generally found below 1500 m (5000 ft). Apparently has expanded range into new croplands since 1900 (Ehrlich et al. 1988)(quoted from Green et al. based on Zeiner et al. 1990). \r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Trans-Pecos area of Texas, most frequently in desert scrub (dominated by creosote bush [Larrea tridentata] or creosote bush and mesquite as co-dominants) or agricultural croplands, or where these 2 habitats converge (Ohlendorf 1974, Gamble 1985). Majority of nests in Trans-Pecos area of Texas are within habitats that include shade trees or human-made structures (Ohlendorf 1971, Gamble 1985). In w. Nebraska, open riparian woodland dominated by eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides; Bergin 1987, 1993). In Missouri River Breaks area of Montana, riparian forests (dominated by plains cottonwood [Populus sargentii]) and pine (Pinus flexilis)-juniper (Juniperus scopulorum) woodland (Walcheck 1970). In Alberta, riparian zones of the prairies, farm shelter belts, and prairie towns (Salt and Salt 1976)(quoted directly from Gamble and Bergin 2012).\r\n\r\nSoutheast:\r\nRegular winter resident in s. Florida (Greene 1944, Stevenson and Anderson 1994). Occurs annually (but rarely) until early Jan along the Gulf Coast and along the Atlantic Coast north to Massachusetts; seldom farther north. Usually seen along the immediate coast in these areas (e.g., Veit and Petersen 1993). Very few verified winter records for w. and interior U.S. Winter habitat is similar to breeding-range habitats. General habitats in Mexico include open grasslands with scattered trees and shrubs and farmlands (Edwards 1972, Howell and Webb 1995). In Guatemala, open woodlands, plantations, edges of meadows and fields (Land 1970)(quoted directly from Gamble and Bergin 2012).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bWEKIx", "ELCode": "ABPAE52050", "scientific_name": "Tyrannus verticalis", "ITIS_TSN": "178287", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104787", "common_name": "Western Kingbird"}}
