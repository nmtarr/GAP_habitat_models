(1991) are explicit regarding the range of G. breviceps vs. the range of G. attwateri noting that \"The Brazos River significantly affects the distribution of G. breviceps and maintains this species' allopatric distribution with G. attwateri located on the western side of the river.\" However, in Schmidly's (2004) second edition of The Mammals of Texas, range maps depict locations and polygon portions for each of these two species on either side of the river. He also includes the following remarks regarding their ranges: \"A small zone of contact between G. breviceps and G. attwateri occurs just west of the Brazos River in Burleson Coutny. Of 42 gophers collected in this area, 31% had an appraent karyotype intermediate between the two species, indicating that hybridization may occur in the wild. In general, the range of G. attwateri is limited on the north by the Brazos River, although small zones of contact with G. breviceps (the range of which is limited on the south by the Brazos River) may occur wher the Brazos River has periodically changed course in the past.\" I chose to include range portions on either side of the Brazos river per Schmidly's maps and considered that sampling along the entire potential contact zone along the river probably has not taken place (the text only referring to an area in Burleson County). Hence I was conservative in assuming the hybridization is occuring almost completely from north to south, leaving only a small area of non-overlapping HUCs in the south. M. Rubino, 15 August, 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Attwater's pocket gopher is a geomyid rodent endemic to southern Texas. Preferred habitat consists primarily of sandy soils (along with slity clay loam soils) in periennial bunchgrass and annual forb/grass communities (Williams and Cameron 1984, 1991, Cameron et al. 1988). Grassland habitats overlying exclusively clay soils are avoided (Cameron et al. 1988, Schmidly 2004). The species is almost entirely fossorial, rarely seen above ground. It's distribution may locally be limited by the presence of fire ant communities (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mAPGOx", "ELCode": "AMAFC02050", "scientific_name": "Geomys attwateri", "ITIS_TSN": "552516", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101594", "common_name": "Attwater's Pocket Gopher"}}
