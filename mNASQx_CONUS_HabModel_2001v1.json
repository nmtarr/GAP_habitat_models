It was once distributed across the western and southern portions of the Tulare Basin, San Joaquin Valley, and the Upper Cuyama Valley, and on the Carrizo and Elkhorn Plains (USFWS 1998).   \r\n\r\n\u201dPopulations now exist primarily in marginal habitats of low foothills and mountains on the western edge of the San Joaquin Valley; significant populations occur only in western Kern County at Elk Hills and on portions of the Carrizo and Elkhorn plains. In the northern part of range, low density populations occur in the Panoche and Kettleman hills\u201d (NatureServe 2015).\r\n\r\nThe best habitat for this species has nearly completely been destroyed, and it is now restricted to marginal habitats (USFWS 1998).  Suitable habitat is arid (<23 cm mean precipitation per year) annual grassland or shrubland, with loamy soil. Most habitat has sparse to moderate shrub cover but shrubless areas support viable populations (USFWS 1998).  Shrub species that are common in habitat are saltbush, California ephedra, California juniper, matchweed, one-sided bluegrass (Poa secunda ssp. secunda), red brome, and red-stemmed filaree (USFWS 1998).\r\n\r\nThis species is only found at relatively low elevations; from 50-60 m up to 1,100 m, with occurrence more rare above 800 m (NatureServe 2015, USFWS 1998).
