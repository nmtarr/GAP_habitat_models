It also occupies shallow waters, forested wetland, herbaceous wetland, scrub-shrub wetland, and riparian habitats. This snake inhabits bayous, pond and lake margins, swamps, sluggish streams, rice fields, roadside ditches, and river-bottom sloughs. Burrowing takes place in or using soil, fallen log, and leaf litter. Other forms of cover include water-edge vegetation, crayfish burrows, and under shore debris (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Gibbons and Dorcas 2004; Johnson 2000; Trauth et al. 2004; Werler and Dixon 2000).\r\n\r\n\r\nSE-\tVegetation found along various water bodies.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rGCSNx", "ELCode": "ARADB27020", "scientific_name": "Regina grahamii", "ITIS_TSN": "174127", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100772", "common_name": "Graham's Crayfish Snake"}}
