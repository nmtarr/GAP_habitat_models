Yucca torreyi), blackbush, lechuguilla and scrub-grassland (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, NatureServe 2004). PNV-grama \"short-grass\", Great Basin desertscrub, Chihuahuan desertscrub (Thompson et al. 1996). It is primarily found in semiarid and desert grassland environments, including sand dunes and shrub-and-cactus-grasslands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994, Frey 2004). Short-grass-tree-cactus  habitat is the most favorable (Thompson et al. 1996). It is sometimes found in juniper savannah and shinnery oak scrub (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). N. micropus is assocated with rock outcrops, cliffs, and ledges (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002), but it is often found far from rocky habitats (Findley et al. 1975, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It burrows along the sides of arroyos and favors outwash plains and overgrazed lands (Thompson et al. 1996). Seeds of Yucca glauca are eaten by the species (Braun and Mares 1989).  It eats mainly joints of cholla, but also currant, yucca, juniper, milkweed, Russian-thistle, blue grama, and copper mallow (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs on rocky, gravelly, and sandy soils (Braun and Mares 1989, Thompson et al. 1996). The home range is between 0.03ha and 0.13ha in Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). Home ranges mimic the cactus patch or patches utilized by the species (Braun and Mares 1989). The mean average distance of movement from the center of activity is 6.9-14.1m (Braun and Mares 1989). In New Mexico the species occurs at elevations between 915 and 2,073m (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, Johnson et al. 2003). N. micropus occurs in southeast Colorado (Braun and Mares 1989, Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found at lower elevations throughout New Mexico except in the San Juan Basin and San Luis Valley (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, this species occupies semiarid brushlands and valley pastures adjacent to water on the Edwards Plateau. It is usually associated with a variety of cacti and desert thorn shrubs. Typical forage includes fruit of prickly pear and other cacti, mesquite pods, acorns, sotol leaves, and agave (Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSPWOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF08020", "scientific_name": "Neotoma micropus", "ITIS_TSN": "180376", "Global_SEQ_ID": "100142", "common_name": "Southern Plains Woodrat"}}
