PNV - mixed \"shortgrass\" and Great Basin desertscrub (Thompson 1996).  In NM it occurs everywhere except \"well-developed\" mixed coniferous and spruce fir communities in San Juan, Jemez, and Sangre de Christo Mountains (Thompson et al. 1996).  R. Megalotis is found in the Mogollons in a meadow surrounded by spruce fir (Thompson et al. 1996).  It should be found in all mountains in New Mexico (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  Grasses are the preferred cover, and since they are more plentiful in moist areas the mouse is usually found there (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  It is found among cottonwood, willow, pinyon-juniper, western live oak, limber pine, white fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Chihuahuan pine, Apache pine, bristle-cone pine, bristlecone pine, border pinyon, alligator juniper, gray oak, emory oak, Gambel's oak, Toumey's oak, sand sage, winter-fat, creosotebush, tarbush, ocotillo, yucca, tumbleweed, mesquite, cocklebur, fir, aspen, bracken, broom snakeweed, rubber rabbitbrush, spiny greasebush, fourwing saltbush, redberry juniper, silverleaf and netleaf oaks, shinnery oak scrub, sedges, cattails, muhly, fescue, grama and buffalograss, galleta and ricegrass, big bluestem, sand bluestem, alkali sacaton, tobosa, alder, Apache plume, sunflowers, grain, alfalfa, shortgrass-sacahuiste, and greasebush (Thompson et al. 1996, New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000).  One was taken next to a rock adjacent to a Ribes thicket (Hoffmeister et al. 1954).  It eats mainly seeds from grasses, legumes, and mustards (Zeveloff 1988).  Elevation is between -77m in Death Valley, California and 4,000m in Mexico (Webster and Jones, Jr. 1982). Individuals show movements of 200-300ft in a live-trap grid and a homing ability of 1,000ft (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2000). The home range is 0.2ha (NatureServe 2003).  The species occurs throughout Arizona except in much of the Mojave and Sonoran desertscrub and the montane Mogollon Plateau (Hoffmeister 1986).  The mouse occurs in the San Luis Valley, valleys of the Western Slope, and the eastern plains of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It occurs throughout Nevada (Hall 1995). The species occurs throughout New Mexico (Findley et al. 1975, Frey 2004). R. megalotis is found everywhere in Utah except the northeast (Durrant 1952, Utah GAP 1997).\r\nIn California, R. megaltis is distributed throughout the state including the Channel and Catalina Islands although it is absent from higher elevations. The species is common to abundant in shrublands, grasslands, and early seral stages of many forested habitats preferring thick grass and shrub cover for foraging and nesting (Brylski et al. [CAWHR 2005] based on Zeiner et al. 1990).\r\n\r\nNorthwest:\r\nIn Oregon, the western harvest mouse is found east of the Cascade Mts. With the exception of the southern part of the state in the Siskiyou-Klamath regions and is absent from the Blue and Wallowa Mts. In the northeast (Verts and Carraway 1998). It inhabits grassy and shrubby vegetation including sagebrush, marsh, meadows, grazed marsh, bitter-brush, rabbit-brush, cottonwood, and willow (Verts and Carraway 1998).\r\n\r\nGreat Plains:\r\nIn Texas, Schmidly (2004) describes habitat as \"favors grassy and weedy habitats such as lightly razed pastures, meadows, fencerows, fallow fields, and edge habitats between agricultural and riparian areas. Meadows, marshes, and weed-covered banks of irrigation ditches seem to offer optimum habitat conditions. The species seldom is found in forested areas. In the Big Bend area it has been taken in grasslands, riparian, and desert scrub situations. On the Llano Estacado it prefers grassy, weedy, brushy rencewrows and highway rights-of-way\".", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mWHMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF02030", "scientific_name": "Reithrodontomys megalotis", "ITIS_TSN": "180343", "Global_SEQ_ID": "105306", "common_name": "Western Harvest Mouse"}}
