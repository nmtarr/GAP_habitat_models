As of May 2013, the species is comprised of five subspecies, but one, A. b. nevadensis, is likely to be elevated to species status. Four subspecies live in the U.S.\r\n\r\nIn general, Sage Sparrows are associated shrub-steppe communities in the northern portion of their range and chaparral and shrub lands of the southern part.  However, shrub type may be less important than vertical structure, patchiness, shrub spacing, and vegetation density (Martin and Carlson 1998); they breed in semi-open scrublands with evenly spaced shrubs 1 -2 m high (Chase and Carlson 2002).  They are reportedly less common in fragmented shrub lands (Chase and Carlson 2002).\r\n\r\nIn transmontane CA, they can be found in sagebrush, alkali desert scrub, and desert scrub; and in cismontane CA, they can be found in chamise and coastal scrub. (Zeiner et al. 1990).  They have not been found in canyons within the city of San Diego (Chase and Carlson 2002).\r\n\r\nThe Bell\u2019s Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli belli) lives in dry chaparral and coastal sage scrub of brittlebush, black sage, California buckwheat, California sagebrush, bush mallow, chamise, white sage, valley cholla, ceonothus, willow and bunchgrasses (Martin and Carlson 1998; Cicero 2010).  It prefers California sagebrush and brittlebush.  Chamise chaparral  is used in northern part of its range and in coastal San Diego County along with redshanks.  At higher elevations in the sourthern CA mountains, sagebrush is used (Chase and Carlson 2002).  They are less common in tall, dense, old chaparral (Chase and Carlson 2002).  Records exist of this species between 1219-1829 m in July in California.\r\n\r\nArtemisiospiza belli canescens occurs in drier desert scrub habitats of saltbush, shadscale, bitterbrush, big sagebrush, and rabbitbrush (Cicero 2010).  It is sometimes found in creosote bush-goldenhead desert scrub.  Individuals have been documented between 1219-1829 m in July in California and the type specimen was recorded in 1905 at 1676 m.  Some individuals are believed to move up in elevation following breeding (Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nThe San Clemente Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli clementeae) is only found on San Clemente Island, CA in maritime desert scrub (Martin and Carlson 2002, Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nThe Great Basin Sage Sparrow (Artemisiospiza belli nevadensis) is found in Great Basin sagebrush, either pure stands or those interspersed with bitterbrush, saltbrush, shadscale, rabbitbrush or greasewood (Martin and Carlson 1998).  They are rare in mixed sagebrush-juniper except where adjacent to shrub-steppe (Martin and Carlson 1998).  They have been documented up to 2400 m in elevation but usually breed below 1700 m (Martin and Carlson 1998, Cicero 2010).\r\n\r\nDuring winter, Great Basin Sage Sparrows migrate south while the other subspecies either move short distances or remain on their breeding grounds.  Winter habitats include breeding habitats as well as desert washes, creosote bush, sparse cactus scrub, arid grasslands, arboreal yucca mixed with greasewood and honey mesquite and inkweed communities along the Colorado River (Martin and Carlson 1998).
