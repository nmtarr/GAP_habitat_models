It prefers forests with numerous, large-diameter snags (Jung et al., 1999).\r\n\r\nThough generally said to avoid shrublands and grasslands, especially at low elevations (Jones, 1965; Adams, 2003), they have been detected in alpine meadows (Krutzsch and Heppenstall, 1955), sagebrush-grass openings, (Oliver, 2000), and grassy valleys (Turner and Jones, 1968); in each cited instance individuals were within close proximity to forest. Those found in the Great Plains grasslands were most likely migrants (Armstrong, 1972). On one occasion, the species has been captured miles from the nearest forest or woodland (Easterla, 1965), although this may have been a transient or migratory individual.\r\n\r\nRoosts are generally in tree cavities (Perkins and Cross, 1988; Campbell et al., 1996; Mattson et al., 1996; Betts, 1998; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998) or under exfoliating bark (Campbell et al., 1996; Mattson et al., 1996), and the species disproportionately selected ponderosa and western white pines for roost sites (Campbell et al., 1996). It has also roosted under a bridge (Geluso and Mink, 2009) and occasionally in buildings (Hardy, 1941).\r\n\r\nThough the species is sometimes active during winter (Geluso, 2007), they generally hibernate in\r\nmines, caves, tree cavities, rock crevices, and buildings  (Hardy, 1941; Turner and Jones, 1968; Kunz, 1982; Whitaker and Hamilton, 1998; Tigner and Stukel, 2002).\r\n\r\nSilver-haired bat forages over the tops of trees and over open water (Adams, 2003), and is generally found near water sources (Easterla, 1965; Kunz, 1982; Parsons et al., 1986; AZDFG, 2004; Duff and Morrell, 2007).\r\n\r\nMaximum elevations for the species are around 3000 m (Oliver, 2000).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mSHBAx", "ELCode": "AMACC02010", "scientific_name": "Lasionycteris noctivagans", "ITIS_TSN": "180014", "Global_SEQ_ID": "104362", "common_name": "Silver-haired Bat"}}
