This species is also found in Vancouver Island, while absent from Queen Charlotte Islands, occupying moist habitats (Green et al. 2013). This species is found in open grassland, forest, or woodland, where during the day, can be found under rocks, logs, and near water. Spawns in ponds, lakes, and slower parts of streams (Stebbins 2003).\r\n\r\nEgg deposition takes place 0.5-1m below the water surface on cattails and submerged plants, and on the wetland bottom (Petranka 1998; Lannoo 2005). The larvae obtain cover in terrestrial habitats from vegetation and shallows (Neish 1971). Adults will spend most of the year in rodent burrows and migrations have been reported even when snow and ice are apparent (Nussbaum et al. 1983).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "aNOSAx", "ELCode": "AAAAA01040", "scientific_name": "Ambystoma gracile", "ITIS_TSN": "173597", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103251", "common_name": "Northwestern Salamander"}}
