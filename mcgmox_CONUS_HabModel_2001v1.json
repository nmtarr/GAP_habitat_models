This species may also be referred to as Mearn's grasshopper mouse. Onychomys arenicola occurs in low, arid, gravelly desert areas where creosotebush, mesquite, yucca, lechuguilla, condalia, etc. are sparse and scattered (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). It occurs in shortgrass plains, sacaton grassland, riparian, juniper savannah, and oak savannah (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). The species may be found on the desert pavements of bajadas and other more obdurate soils (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). O. arenicola is found among snakeweed, rabbitbrush, gramma and buffalograss, cottonwood, alder, sycamore, willow, and Apache plume (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002, NatureServe 2003). One was taken from a burrow underneath a Schmaltzia microphylla bush (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). It lives in burrows of its own or usurped from small rodents (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). The species drinks considerable ammounts of water in captivity (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002).  It occurs in southeast Arizona, as well as New Mexico (NatureServe 2003). The range was created from Frey (2004) and previous data from New Mexico GAP and NatureServe. In Texas, this mouse inhabits low, arid, sandy or gravelly desert areas where desert scrub vegetation such as creosote bush, mesquite, yucca, etc. is sparse and scattered (quoted from Schmidly 2004).", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "mCGMOx", "ELCode": "AMAFF06030", "scientific_name": "Onychomys arenicola", "ITIS_TSN": "180381", "Global_SEQ_ID": "103555", "common_name": "Chihuahuan Grasshopper Mouse"}}
