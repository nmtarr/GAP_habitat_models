They are non-migratory so winter and breeding distributions are similar, but seasonal changes in weather and food availability can cause seasonal changes in dsitribution (Giudice and Ratti 2001).  Breeding is disjunct in many areas and annual releases of new birds make range delineation of established populations difficult (Giudice and Ratti 2001).  \r\n\r\nIn the SWReGAP region, populations are established in all five of the states. The SWReGAP project range for Colorado followed Kuenning (1998), Nevada BBA and NBC for Nevada (GBBO, unpublished data), and county occurrence (Mitchell, pers.comm., 2005) for Utah.  The range in Arizona and New Mexico follows Giudice and Ratti (2001).  Watersheds where it is established are coded K34 for year-round occurrence. \r\n It is a common resident in Utah where it has been introduced into all agricultural areas of the state and has historically been collected in every county (Hayward et al. 1976).  They still occur in all counties in Utah except Grand, Kane, Rich, San Juan, Summit, Wasatch, and Washington (Mitchell, personal communication, 2005).  Ring-necked Pheasants are common residents locally in Colorado both east and west of the Continental Divide but are most numerous in eastern Colorado (Bailey and Niedrach 1965; Kuenning 1998).  They have been introduced into many parts of Nevada where they currently may be found in cultivated valleys in northern, eastern, and southern portions of the state (Alcorn 1988; Giudice and Ratti 2001; GBBO, unpublished Nevada Bird Count and Nevada Breeding Bird Atlas data).  They are residents in northern, eastern, and southern New Mexico (Ligon 1961; Giudice and Ratti 2001).  Monson and Phillips (1981) stated that this bird had been repeatedly introduced into Arizona but that no populations were established. However, Giudice and Ratti (2001) show range in Arizona in confined areas on the border of Baja, California and also on the border of southwest New Mexico.  \r\n\r\nRing-necked pheasants are adaptable to various types of habitats and their habitat associations vary across their range in response to local conditions. They are mostly associated with agricultural areas, but will inhabit any type of semi-open area, such as the edge of marshes and forests, grassy ditches, hedges, brushy fields, hedgrows, and especially, crop lands with grassy patches as well as wild haylands, old fields, and native warm-grass prairies (Guidice & Ratti 2001, NRCS Fish & Wildlife Habitat Management Leaflet 1999).  The ring-necked pheasant prefers agriculture because in all seasons its diet is primarily grain from agricultural fields (Giudice and Ratti 2001).  Ideal habitat is agriculture interspersed with patches of marsh or riparian areas, grassy ditches or idle fields, and weedy fencerows or rows of brush/shrubs (Davis 1997; Giudice and Ratti 2001).  It especially favors marshy areas with cattails, which provide important winter cover (Davis 1997; Giudice and Ratti 2001).  Open water is not required but the largest populations of pheasants are found where water is accessible (Giudice and Ratti 2001).\r\n\r\nDuring summer, individuals tend to roost in trees or dense shrubs but may use grassy patches such as alfalfa fields.  During fall they use wetland vegetation, standing grain crops, conservation plantings, stubble fields, fencerows, ungrazed hay fields, weedy areas, and brushy woodlots (Giudice and Ratti 2001).  Nests are placed in dry grasses and forbs from the previous year\u2019s growing season within roadsides, fence lines, ditches, rights-of-way, wetlands, forest edges, and diverted cropland or waste areas (Giudice and Ratti 2001).  Broods are reared in the same habitats where nests are placed and a study in northern Iowa found that birds in landscapes with 25% grass and legume cover had better reproductive success than those in landscapes with 10% grass and legume cover (Giudice and Ratti 2001).\r\n\r\nIn the Southwest region, it can be found in croplands, hayfields, rural shelter belts, orchards, riparian areas and marshes, and sometimes in the edges of sagebrush or scrub oak when adjacent to agriculture (Cottam 1929; Behle 1955; Hayward et al. 1976; Leptich 1992; Kuenning 1998; Giudice and Ratti 2001). However, in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, it is primarily confined to irrigated agricultural areas and wet meadows (Bartmann 1969; Hayward et al. 1976; Andrews and Righter 1992, Kuenning 1998; Ammon, pers. Comm., 2005; Mitchell, pers.comm., 2005).  In some areas of its range, the pheasant may use sagebrush for nesting, for shade in summer, or for cover in winter (Bartmann 1969; Leptich 199; Giudice and Ratti 2001). The pheasant does not use the open plains or grasslands in Colorado because these areas do not provide not enough cover (Kuenning 1998).  \r\n\r\nElevation range has been reported only from Colorado, where it ranges from the valleys up to 2,743 m (Bailey and Niedrach 1965).  The pheasant is not adapted to desert or mountains (Ligon 1961) and is therefore found at moderate elevations. \r\n\r\nThere are several studies on this species that are specific to the SWReGAP region. In Box Elder Co, Utah, the most successful nests were in retired acreage seeded to alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and crested wheat grass (Agropyron cristatum).  In Utah County, Utah, the majority of nests were in hayfields (alfalfa), irrigated pasture (tall wheat grass Agropyron elongatum), wet meadow (sedges Carex spp.,wiregrass Juncus spp.), and herbaceous weeds (whitetop Cardaria draba, pepperweed Lepidium perfoliatum) (Wood and Brotherson 1981).  In ne Colorado, nests were more abundant in weeds, alfalfa, and along roadsides compared to winter wheat, but pheasants did use winter wheat for renesting (Snyder 1984). Two-thirds of Colorado Breeding Bird Atlas blocks where the pheasant was located were in croplands or rural settings; the remainder were in riparian areas, marshes, sagebrush, and scrub oak (Kuenning 1998).  Preliminary SWReGAP habitat models for this species included sagebrush and scrub oak systems; however, this resulted in a model that was much too widespread given the extensiveness of these drier ecological systems in the region and the reliance of this bird on agricultural areas (Ammon, pers. Comm., 2005; Mitchell, pers. Comm., 2005). Therefore, the final model excludes these systems.\r\n\r\nWinter and summer habitats are typically the same but shifts in habitat use sometimes occur.  A study in the Palouse Prairie of eastern Washington documented birds moving from agricultural fields in summer to nearby riparian habitats in winter.  Similar roosting habitats are used during winter: wetland vegetation including cattail (Typha spp.), bulrush (Scirpus spp.), and canary grass (Phalaris spp.), warm season-perenial grasses, canary grasses, weed patches, fence lines, roadsides, ditches, railroad right-of-ways, shrub-carr wetlands, willows (Salix spp.), pine plantations, straw stacks, and sweet clover (Melilotus spp.) (Giudice and Ratti 2001).
