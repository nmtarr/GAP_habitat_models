Numerous subspecies exist; some people recognize 28 different ones.  Migratory behavior and habitat affinities vary across some subspecies.  Most populations of the Savannah Sparrow are migratory, but the subspecies that breed in Mexico and coastal California are resident.\r\nSavannah Sparrows usually occur in fields that have some herbaceous plants or weeds in addition to grasses (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).  The list of habitats where they can be found includes agricultural fields (especially alfalfa), lightly grazed pastures, roadsides, sedge bogs, blueberry barrens, hay fields, abandoned fields, grassy meadows, open grasslands, wet meadows associated with streams, open water, or mountain parks, coastal and inland marshes, coastal grasslands, grassy dunes, tallgrass prairie, mixed-grass prairie, and tundra (Johnsgard 1979, Wheelwright and Rising 2008).\r\nIn the Great Plains, they breed in tallgrass prairies and irrigated hayfields, but they avoid urban areas.  Breeding densities are high in montane meadows of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.   In northern Canada and Alaska, they inhabit dwarf willows and birches and feed in conifers (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).  The P.s. princeps subspecies, which breeds in Nova Scotia, is almost exclusively found in coastal American marram grass (Ammophila breviligulata; Wheelwright and Rising 2008).  In arid portions of their range, Savannah Sparrows are restricted to moist irrigated areas or grassy margins of ponds.  The P.s. beldingi and P.s. rostratus subspecies, which are found in Baja California and northwest Sonora, inhabit tidal salt marshes, coastal estuarine marshes, and alkaline sumps (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).  \r\n\r\nSavannah Sparrows are generally believed to avoid areas with extensive tree cover and favor moist areas with dense ground vegetation, especially grasses.  Some research, however, has failed to identify a relationship between vegetation structure, such as plant height and density, and breeding density and success.  Densities can be similar between hayfields of different ages with different plant heights, densities, and proportion of grass versus legume cover (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).  In North Dakota\u2019s mixed-grass prairies, they are commonly present regardless of successional stage (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).  In west Texas, Savannah Sparrows generally avoided habitats with vegetation heights greater than 1 meter unless repeatedly disturbed (Oberholser 1994).\r\n\r\nSavannah Sparrows place their nests on the ground in thick herbaceous cover where they are hidden from above by overhanging vegetation (DeGraaf et al. 1991).  They often place them at the bases of goldenrods (Solidago spp.), blueberry, raspberry, blackberry (Rubus spp.), wild rose (Rosa virginica), or bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica; Wheelwright and Rising 2008).\r\n\r\nWhile nesting, Savannah Sparrows will forage in sedge bogs, tundra, beach wrack, mud flats (near cover), dune grasses, and on the ground in areas dominated by short grasses within pastures some distance from the nest.  Individuals will temporarily leave territories for foraging habitats up to 200 m away (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).\r\n\r\nThis species has at times been considered sensitive to patch size, with grassland patches of 10-15 ha required.  However, studies have found that landscape composition affects habitat suitability independent of grassland patch size and they are area-insensitive in Saskatchewan and north-central U.S. (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).\r\n\r\nMost populations are migratory, inhabiting the southern portions of the U.S. during winter.  Winter habitats include grasslands, cultivated fields, roadsides, pastures, golf courses, roadsides, dumps, dunegrass, salt marshes, coastal estuaries, and other open habitats, and wintering birds favor areas of short vegetation (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).  They are common to abundant in irrigated fields of the lower Colorado River Valley and elsewhere in irrigated valleys, grassy swales and plains, and along bodies of water in Lower Sonoran Zone throughout southern and western Arizona (Phillips et al. 1978).  Kingery (1998) reported several records from the San Luis Valley as well as scattered breeding pairs on the eastern plains of Colorado.  They only occur in southern Arizona as migrants and winter residents, where they were found to be more abundant on burned areas than unburned areas (Gordon 2000).  In Clark County, Nevada, they inhabit riparian areas, but only during winter (Alcorn 1988). \r\n\r\nP.s. rostratus is more of a generalist during winter than during summer.  It breeds in salt marshes but will winter in sparsely vegetated areas of dry islands, beaches, wharves and even city streets (Wheelwright and Rising 2008).\r\n\r\nN.
