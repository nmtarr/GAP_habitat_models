Hardy (1976) reported populations were found from near sea level altitudes to at least 1500 meters.\r\n\r\nThe habitat is generally described as riparian. This species is found in cropland, hedgerow, chaparral, shrubland, orchard environment, and hardwood woodland. Throughout its range this species occurs in a variety of moist habitats; from the edges of rivers and creeks along the lower Rio Grande floodplain, irrigated residential lawns in southern Texas and Tamaulipas to the tropical and cloud forest of southern Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Ernst and Ernst 2003; Hardy 1976; Tennant 1998; Werler and Dixon 2000).\r\n\r\nGP\t - Associated with cactus, mesquite, acacia, and palo verde that are found near water or along the edges of the lower Rio Grande. In its southernmost locations in the tropical and cloud forests of Mexico, its vegetation associations have not been described in detail.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rTHNSx", "ELCode": "ARADB15010", "scientific_name": "Ficimia streckeri", "ITIS_TSN": "174228", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101023", "common_name": "Tamaulipan Hook-nosed Snake"}}
