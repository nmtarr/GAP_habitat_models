They are also associated with plant communities dominated by greasewood, sagebrush, and shadscale (Linsdale 1938, Hall 1946, Currie and Goodwin 1996, Flinders and Chapman 2003).\r\n\r\nSouthwest:\r\nThe black-tailed jack rabbit is restricted to areas below 2150 m in Colorado where they are associated with semidesert shrublands and grasslands (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is found throughout New Mexico below the zone of ponderosa forest, though it is occasionally seen in open ponderosa forests (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Preferred habitat is open country with scattered thickets or shrub patches (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Coyotes are closely tied to the jackrabbit population over much of the western United States and there is evidence that this interaction impacts of both species (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). L. californicus is common throughout Arizona wherever open or semi-open country exists; it rarely occurs as high as open pine forests (Hoffmeister 1986).  It is found in mesquite, sagebrush, desertscrub, into open pinyon-juniper (Hoffmeister 1986). Grazing of rangelands by cattle and horses may enhance habitat for the jackrabbit (Hoffmeister 1986). Great Basin Desert scrub is limited to the northwestern portion of New Mexico and differs from all others in North America in that most of the moisture is in the form of snow (Frey and Yates 1996). This habitat is dominated by shrubs including big sagebrush and four-wing saltbush with sparse ground cover (Frey and Yates 1996). Mammals associated with these cold deserts include the black-tailed jack rabbit (Frey and Yates 1996). The black-tailed jackrabbit is found primarily in open areas or brushlands of foothills, lower valleys, and desert areas of Utah (UCDC 2003). The black-tailed jackrabbit may enter open ponderosa pine forest but in general it is most common in more open treeless habitats (Findley 1987). In dry years the jackrabbit feeds more extensively on cacti (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 2002). Some jackrabbits used badger (Taxidea taxus) burrows during winter, especially when deep snow reduced mobility (Smith 1990). The home range in Utah varies from 1-3ha (NatureServe 2004). The elevational range is up to 3,750m (Best 1996). L. californicus occurs statewide in Arizona (Hoffmeister 1986). It is found along the western border and the eastern half of Colorado (Fitzgerald et al. 1994). It is present statewide in Nevada (Hall 1995).
