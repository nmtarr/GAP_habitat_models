Also can be found near urbanized settings on walls, fences, and buildings (Brennan and Holycross 2009). The elevational range of Urosaurus ornatus includes sea level regions and up to areas above 2440m. This species is found in extreme southeastern California, southern Nevada, southern Utah, western areas of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and western and central Texas into northern Mexico. An occupant of cottonwoods, oak, pine, and juniper woodlands that also ventures well into urban spaces (Jones and Lovich 2009). Conant and Collins (1998) report the range of Urosaurus ornatus extending northern Utah and extreme southwest Wyoming.\r\n\r\nIn New Mexico, Urosaurus ornatus is described as arboreal in riparian zones or where rocky habitat is not present or abundant. A species found at low and moderate elevations in xeric environments, but also present at elevations of 950 to approximately 2500m in portions of the Organ Mountains, Dona Ana County, and lava fields located south of the state. Also found in the Guadalupe Mountains of Eddy and Otero counties (Degenhardt et al. 1996). Mesquite, alder, tamarisk, and rough-bark eucalyptus are frequent preferred sites, but also present in treeless areas (Stebbins 2003). It can also be found in the Green River drainage of northeastern Utah, in northwestern Colorado, and in the Flaming Gorge found in extreme southwestern Wyoming where it inhabits rocky canyons, slopes into lower deserts and up to juniper/pinon forests (St. John 2002).\r\n\r\nRiparian and terrestrial Habitats include cliffs, desert shrubland, chaparral, conifer forest, and hardwood woodland. Found in association to mesquite, oak, pine, juniper, alder, cottonwood, tamarisk, and rough-bark eucalyptus.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "rOTLIx", "ELCode": "ARACF16030", "scientific_name": "Urosaurus ornatus", "ITIS_TSN": "173954", "Global_SEQ_ID": "101381", "common_name": "Ornate Tree Lizard"}}
