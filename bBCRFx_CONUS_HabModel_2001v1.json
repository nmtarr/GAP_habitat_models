In Colorado, this species breeds in all mountain ranges above timberline (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998). In New Mexico, they are found breeding in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains from Latir Peak south to Wheeler Peak and from Jacarilla Peak south to Lake Peak in north central New Mexico (Johnson et al. 2000). The Brown-Capped Rosy Finch nests above timberline from 3350m to 4330m throughout its range (Johnson et al. 2000). Most nesting occurs on cliffs, caves, rockslides, or old buildings in areas where the nest is protected from falling rocks or hail (Johnson et al. 2000). Nesting sites are often adjacent to close to tundra, fell fields, rockslides, snowfields, or glaciers that serve as feeding grounds for this finch (Johnson et al. 2000). Nesting sites may occur in enclaves of alpine habitat on northeast facing slopes whose summits are below timberline but still contain cliffs, shade, and snow to produce an alpine climate (Johnson et al. 2000). The data for the range in elevation is taken from the BNA account by Johnson et. al. (2000).\r\nWintering:\r\nThe Brown-Capped Rosy Finch (Leucosticte australis) occurs year round in the high mountain regions of southern Wyoming south through western Colorado into north central New Mexico (Johnson et al. 2000). This species occurs in most mountain ranges in western and central Colorado (Andrews and Righter 1992, Kingery 1998). In New Mexico, they are found in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains from Latir Peak south to Wheeler Peak and from Jacarilla Peak south to Lake Peak in north central New Mexico (Johnson et al. 2000). The Brown-Capped Rosy Finch winters in alpine habitats during mild weather, high parks, meadows, and open valleys of grass or open shrubland between mountain ranges during storms; returns higher when wind exposes higher feeding areas (Johnson et al. 2000). This species usually does not migrate below snowline even in severe winter storms but will remain in areas of minimal snow levels until conditions improve (Johnson et al. 2002). During times of severe weather and limited food sources, the Brown-Capped Rosy Finch will utilize bird feeders in urban or other areas of food sources not found in natural habitats (Johnson et al. 2000). Wintering areas in Colorado are typically found at elevations between 1676 to 3505m (Andrews and Righter 1992) and 2440 to 3098m in New Mexico.", "taxonomic": {"gap_code": "bBCRFx", "ELCode": "ABPBY02020", "scientific_name": "Leucosticte australis", "ITIS_TSN": "179223", "Global_SEQ_ID": "106154", "common_name": "Brown-capped Rosy-finch"}}
